<p class="drop-capi-i">In this book is provided a collection of documents
illustrative of European life and institutions from
the German invasions to the Renaissance. Great
discrimination has been exercised in the selection
and arrangement of these sources, which are
intended to be used in connection with the study of mediæval
history, either in secondary schools or in the earlier
years of college. Throughout, the controlling thought has
been to present only those selections which are of real
value and of genuine interest&mdash;that is, those which subordinate
the purely documentary and emphasize the strictly
narrative, such as annals, chronicles, and biographies. The
extracts are of considerable length from fewer sources,
rather than of greater number from a wider range. The
translations have all been made with care, but for the sake
of younger pupils simplified and modernized as much as
close adherence to the sense would permit. An introductory
explanation, giving at some length the historical setting of
the extract, and commenting on its general significance, accompanies
each translation. The index is very full.</p>

<p class="authorindent">BY DONALD E. SMITH, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>There are few persons who will question
the importance of a liberal use of good
maps as a supplement to and even a part
of the teaching of history in high schools
and colleges, and there are few teachers
who are not perplexed by the difficulties in
the selection and use of these essential aids
to the teaching of their subject. Owing
to the considerable cost of this kind of
apparatus there is bound to be the ever-present
financial difficulty. Owing to the
great number of publications purporting to
meet the needs of the history teacher, from
small outline maps costing less than a cent
apiece to elaborate atlases costing fifty dollars,
there is a great range of choice within
which there is no little difficulty in deciding
just what cartographical aids are best
for the problem at hand. As the financial
question is always dependent upon
local and particular considerations, and as
the actual handling of maps is a subject in
itself large enough for a separate article,
I will limit myself to the matter of the
selection of the best maps.</p>

<p>It is assumed, of course, that a selection
has to be made. There are few institutions
wealthy enough to buy indiscriminately
everything offered for sale, and even were
that generally true, an indiscriminate use
of good and bad materials could not be
countenanced anyway. The question is
then, what are the most useful maps that
may be made available for schools with but
limited means at their disposal.</p>

<p>The great merit of a wall map consists
in its size, which makes possible the depicting
on a large scale of the things which
can be represented upon a map, with the
further capital advantage that such a map
can be seen by a great many people at the
same time. Its superiority over the atlas
lies then, not in accuracy, or wealth of
detail, but in its visibility. For this there
is absolutely no substitute; and this advantage,
which for the teacher is almost the
only one, secures for the wall map a place
among the indispensables in classroom
equipment. They can be made to represent
anything that any map can, though their
special province is the exhibition of general
facts where minute details are negligible.
In fact, the encumbering of a large
map with a multitude of names and other
data is the cardinal sin of the cartographer.
The two broad classes of facts put upon
maps are political and physical, and almost
always in combination, as neither one has
very much meaning without the other. Let
us take up the physical maps first, as they
offer the greatest difficulties, are the most
expensive, and in consequence, are most
rarely found of a satisfactory character.</p>

<p>The trouble with a physical map is that
it has the impossible task of showing physical
features as they are and so that they
can be seen. This is impossible, because if
things are shown in their right proportions,
and if such natural features as rivers and
mountains were drawn true to scale they
would appear in most cases as nothing
more than faint lines and specks upon the
map. As it is absolutely necessary that
they be seen clearly at some distance, a
gross exaggeration of their apparent size
is made necessary. These difficulties are
successfully compromised in a series well
known in the United States, published by
the house of Perthes, and known as the
Sydow-Habenicht series. In their color
scheme, omission of unnecessary details
and general mechanical excellence, they are
so satisfactory that they have come to be
something like the standard maps for the
continents. Their great English competitor
is Stanford’s new series of orographical
school maps, compiled under the direction
of the well-known writer, H. J. Mackinder.
Of an equally high character and
worked out with somewhat greater elaboration
of details are some of the maps
of W. &amp; A. K. Johnston, and the series of
physical maps published in America by the
Rand-McNally Company. Before leaving
the subject of physical wall maps, I want
to say a word of commendation of the
maps of Dietrich Reimer, of Berlin, prepared
by Richard Kiepert. The classical
maps of Henry Kiepert, published by the
same house, are seen in nearly every high
school in the country, but the work
of Richard Kiepert is altogether too little
known. Owing to the influence of mere
personal taste one should be very cautious
about stating their preferences too confidently
while attempting to discriminate
between a number of different types of
maps, all of which are excellent, but I feel
bound to state that I regard Richard Kiepert’s
map of Central Europe as representing
the great <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">desideratum</i> of map-making.
The essential physiographic features of
that most intricate region, including the
primary and secondary axes of the continent,
are exhibited with such clearness that
it is possible to use this map before a large
class in a college or university lecture
course. For all ordinary purposes of the
high school, the Sydow-Habenicht map of
Europe is sufficient, and as it is the map of
the whole continent, the geographical relationships
of Europe and Africa and Europe
and Asia are shown, as, of course, they
cannot be with the Kiepert map, but no
college class should be denied the privilege
of seeing the Kiepert map or its equivalent,
and if there is an equivalent I am not
acquainted with it. Some of the maps of
the French houses of Delagrave and
Hachette &amp; Company are deserving of
wider use in this country, but our dependence
on English and German publications,
for commercial reasons; is not likely to be
diminished for several years to come.
These French firms apparently make little
effort to advertise their wares in the
United States, so that the difficulty of keeping
track of their latest works and ordering
them when they are known, constitutes a
serious obstacle to their general use.</p>

<p>The second grand division of wall maps
is made up of those which attempt primarily
to show forth political divisions. They
fall naturally into two further divisions;
first, political maps of modern countries
as they are at the present time, and second,
historical maps which represent political
divisions of the earth as they were at
different times in the past. The most
accurate maps of the first class are, generally
speaking, published by the various
governments of the civilized world, particularly
of those military nations whose general
staffs have, from the necessities of
scientific warfare, been driven to preparing
as accurate representations of the surface
of the earth as is humanly possible. Of
course, such maps record the minutest topographical
details, and to that extent are
physical in character, but for that matter,
purely political maps in the sense of totally
ignoring all physical features, are becoming,
happily, almost unknown. All a political
map is, then, is a map which pays relatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
more attention to the human side of geography
than to the physical, and so, as it
were, looks at the face of the continent
from the point of view of man rather than
nature.</p>

<p>There are good maps of the first subdivision
almost without number, and they
are well known by people other than specialists.
Those published in England and
America by such houses as Rand-McNally,
W. &amp; A. K. Johnston, George Philip &amp; Son,
and Edward Stanford may serve as good
examples. They are quite adequate for
the English speaking world and are known
to schoolmen throughout this country.</p>

<p>The subject of historical maps, the second
subdivision in the classification made
above, cannot be dismissed quite so easily,
and the treatment of this topic should not
be relegated to the end of a short article
on maps in general. In this field of cartography,
England and America are distinctly
behind the peoples of the continent of
Europe, so that for maps illustrating historical
geography recourse must be had to
foreign productions, particularly those of
Germany. Without any attempt to make
comparisons, I must content myself with
the bare statement that the two series,
Henry Kiepert for the ancient period, and
Spruner-Bretschneider for the medieval
and modern period, cover the field of
European and Oriental history very satisfactorily
for college classes. The fact that
in the first series all names are in Latin,
and in the second all names are in German,
make these maps unsatisfactory for general
use in the high schools. In lieu of these
products of the firms of Reimer, in Berlin,
and Perthes, in Gotha, there are used very
generally and with satisfaction the cheaper
and cruder historical charts of MacCoun.
The color scheme in these charts is distinctive
if not beautiful, while the few
minor inaccuracies are too unimportant to
affect the general usefulness of the series.</p>

<p>There is no space left for even touching
upon the subject of economic, commercial,
and ethnographic maps; upon the arrangement,
suspension, and classification of the
map collection in any given school or department
of a university; or upon the all-important
topic of atlases, a whole subject
in itself, closely related to the subject of
wall maps, and even more difficult to handle
properly. But these and other matters,
such as the actual handling of maps before
classes, and the treatment of the geographical
factors in history, though closely associated
with the subject of wall maps, are
not within the scope of this article. I shall
be content if the references given here to
particular maps prove specific enough to
give practical aid to the history teacher in
building up the map equipment of his department.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_48">“The American Historical Association, 1884-1909”</h2>


<p class="authorindent">REVIEW OF DR. JAMESON’S RECENT ARTICLE.</p>

<p>A noteworthy article upon the origin of
the American Historical Association and its
history during the past twenty-five years
appears in the October number of “The
American Historical Review.” The author,
Dr. J. Franklin Jameson, is better fitted
than any other man in the country to treat
this subject, and he gives us the early history
of the association with a genial sympathy
that enlists one’s interest at once.</p>

<p>Prefacing his remarks with the statement
that “no agency has been so potent in the
advancement of American historical scholarship”
as the association, Dr. Jameson
points out the conditions of historical research
and pedagogy in the year 1884, in
which the association was founded. There
was but one general historical journal. In
all the universities and colleges of the country
there were apparently only fifteen professors
and five assistant professors who
gave all their time to history. The subject
was in many cases subordinated or annexed
to other topics, including political science,
English literature, geology, German and
French. Yet, despite the small numbers of
those engaged in teaching history, Dr.
Jameson points out that there were giants
in those days, men who were trained when
the German system of history teaching was
at its best, or who, like the great national
literary historians, had advanced far in
their labors.</p>

<p>The specific details of the organization
of the association at Saratoga, September
10, 1884 will be of much interest to the
younger history workers. With kindliness
for diverging views, Dr. Jameson shows how
early in the life of the association problems
arose, the successful settlement of which
had much to do with the future of the organization.
Should the association be a
small one, made up of forty or more “Immortals,”
or should the appeal be made to
a wider constituency, and all interested in
history be invited to join? Should the
association accept incorporation by the nation
and government aid in its work?
Should the meetings be held continuously in
Washington? Should the annual meetings
with the papers read at such meetings be
the sole form of activity entered into by
the association?</p>

<p>The solution of these and other questions,
Dr. Jameson points out, giving credit in
passing to the past and present workers in
the association. He names particularly as
steps in advance the gaining of a charter
from the national government, and incidentally
the placing of the papers of the
association in the hands of the government
for publication.</p>

<p>Taking the year 1895 as a critical point,
he shows that the association had $8,000 in
its treasury and current expenses of not
over forty per cent. of its income, and yet
that its work did not seem to prosper.
From that year, however, the adoption of a
new policy broadened the activities of the
association. The support of the association
was given to “The American Historical
Review”; the American Society of Church
History was affiliated with the main organization:
a Committee of Seven on the
Teaching of History in Secondary Schools
was appointed, and several years afterwards
made its famous report.</p>

<p>Later activities have been added from
time to time; a Standing Committee on
Bibliography, the Historical Manuscripts
Commission, the Public Archives Commission,
the establishment of prizes for original
work in history, the start of the publication
of a series of volumes of “Original Narratives
of Early American History,” the formation
of a Pacific Coast branch, the appointment
of a Committee of Eight on the
Teaching of History in Elementary Schools,
which has but lately reported, and the coöperation
with a British committee to prepare
a select bibliography of modern English
history.</p>

<p>While the field of activities of the association
has thus expanded, the membership
of the association has grown until now it
stands at about twenty-five hundred. Its
funds amount to $26,000. It has a revenue
of $8,000 a year, and the government prints
for it material which represents an outlay
for printing of about $7,000.</p>

<p>Dr. Jameson closes his article with the
statement: “Probably no historical society
in the world is more numerous; it might
perhaps be successfully maintained that
none is more extensively useful. If the
quality of all that it does is not yet of ideal
excellence, it may be that its work is done
as well as can be expected from an organization
no member of which can give to its
concerns more than a minor portion of his
time. At all events, it has played an effective
part in the historical progress of the
last twenty-five years, and none of those
who took part in its foundation at Saratoga,
in that now remote September, need
feel regret at his share in the transaction.
That it may flourish abundantly in the
future must be the wish of all who care
for the interests ‘of American history and
of history in America.’”</p>

<h2 id="Ref_49">The Use of Sources in Instruction in Government and Politics</h2>


<p class="authorindent">BY CHARLES A. BEARD, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR OF POLITICS IN COLUMBUS UNIVERSITY.</p>

<p>What Dr. Stubbs said many years ago
about the difficulty of mastering the history
of institutions applies with equal force
to the mastery of present institutions, especially
in actual operation. Perhaps, in
a way, the student of government is more
fortunately situated than the student of
history, for he can use the laboratory
method to some extent. He may attend
primaries and caucuses, visit the State capital
or the City Hall, take a place among
the spectators in a police court watching
the daily grind, or observe the selectman,
perhaps a drug clerk, superintend the construction
of a town highway. But in the
class-room instruction in government and
politics must perforce deal largely with
abstractions. The historians, long ago recognizing
the vice of unreality which attended
them like a ghost that would not be
downed, cast about for some new method
that would give more firmness and life to
their instruction. In their search they
came upon the sources, and instead of listening
always to the voice of Green or
Stubbs, they stopped to hear the voices of
the kings, monks, warriors and lawyers
who helped to make the history of which
Green and Stubbs wrote. The result, as
all the world knows, has been marvelous.
It has brought more vividness and solidity
to historical instruction. It has done more.
The very method itself, in the hands of
skilled workers, has become a discipline of
the highest value. Whoever doubts it
should read Professor Fling’s article in the
first issue of this magazine. Lawyers likewise
have discovered the same difficulties
which the teachers of history encountered,
and, flinging away Blackstone and the text-books,
they have sought refuge in the
sources alone. Perhaps they have gone too
far with the “case system”; in fact, a reaction
seems imminent at this moment; but
the commentators will never recover their
former sway.</p>

<p>Strange to say, teachers of government
and politics have not yet made any widespread
use of the methods that have been
found so effective in the hands of other
students of institutions, and yet in quantity,
variety and interest the sources available
for their work are practically unlimited.
One of the most important groups
of materials, the government publications,
can be had for the asking; and our waste
baskets are filled with the examples of
another group, the fugitive literature of
party politics. Acres of diamonds have
been at our door, but our instruction in government
and politics wears, in general,
such a barren aspect that keen-sighted students
are aware of its unreality and, slow-switted
ones find no delight or profit in it.
No word in our curriculum suggests such
innocuous futility as “civics,” and yet we
are preparing citizens for service in a
democracy!</p>

<p>But to turn from preachments to some
practical advice, which, I take it, is what
the editor wanted when he asked me to do
this article. The source materials for government
and politics fall readily into four
groups.</p>

<p>I. There are, first, the autobiographies,
memoirs and writings of statesmen, lawyers,
legislators, judges, street-cleaning
commissioners, police superintendents, and
other persons who have actually conducted
some branch of our government. These
books, it is true, are often written to
glorify the authors; but the solemn presentation
of the unvarnished truth was not
always the purpose of the medieval monk
whose chronicle is studied with such zeal
as a source. What could be more charming
or illuminating than Senator Hoar’s
memoirs, Sherman’s recollections, Blaine’s
story of his service in Congress, or Benton’s
view of things? Were there space at my
disposal I could fill this magazine with the
topics on which I have secured informing
notes from Hoar’s work. There are wit,
and humor, and reality on almost every
page. I suspect, and whisper it here under
breath, that a student who reads it will
know more about the Federal Government
than one who devotes his time to memorizing
the sacred Constitution, so prayerfully
drafted by the Fathers.</p>

<p>II. In the second group I would place the
government publications, State and Federal
and municipal. Now I am aware that this
calls up in the minds of many readers visions
of the long rows of repulsive volumes
which cumber our library shelves, and I
know that government reports all look alike
to careless observers. They are not, however.
Even the “Congressional Record” has
pages glistening with information on the
inner workings of Congress and the play
of interests in lawmaking. It takes some
courage for the busy teacher to start on
that formidable monument to the capacity
of the Government Printing Office, but, as
Professor Reinsch has pointed out in the
preface to his splendid collection of materials
on the Federal Government, the process
of studying the sources while irksome
at the beginning soon has the exhilarating
effect on the mind that brisk physical exercise
has on the body. Only one who has
turned from a vest-pocket manual of predigested
“civics” to the apparently cold
and barren waste of the “Congressional
Record” can know the exhilaration of the
experiment. In the debates of the conventions
in which our State Constitutions are
framed we can find materials which will
illuminate every part of our commonwealth
government. Then there are the executive
messages and inaugurals&mdash;voluminous and
forbidding, but even a few hours over them
with pen in hand and a plentiful supply of
page markers will yield fruit never dreamed
of by the teacher who has exhausted his
ingenuity on inventing a table that will
show graphically what powers are coordinate,
exclusive, and reserved in our constitutional
system! Then there are the departmental
reports; I have a shelf full for
the years 1908-09, just in front of my
working table. They give a lot of precise
information on the state of the civil service,
the organization of the army and navy,
the work of the Bureau of Corporations,
the investigations of the Department of
Labor, and the like, which I must have to
give correctness and precision to my instruction
in matters of State and Federal
administration. Then they are indispensable
for reference. I am constantly having
trouble in remembering whether the pension
bureau is a bureau or a division, or is
in the War Department, where it would
seem to belong, or in the Department of
Commerce and Labor, or somewhere else.
It really does not matter so much, for
doubtless most of our best citizens do not
know where it is, especially since, under
our system of indirect taxation, they don’t
feel its hands in their pockets. Finally,
there are Supreme Court decisions. Here
laymen must beware, for the lawyers have
forbidden us to come in; only one who has
mastered the mysteries of real property and
torts, so they would have us believe, can
understand the mysteries of direct taxation
as defined by the Supreme Court of
the United States. Now, we must not take
the lawyers too seriously, but we must
master the elements of law and also learn
how to get the “point” of a case, discover
the facts and separate the necessary
reasoning from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter</i>. Certainly, no
student of American government has any
business teaching the subject unless he has
read and understood many of the greatest
decisions of the august tribunal that presides
over our political destinies.</p>

<p>III. A third group of materials embraces
State and Federal laws. How many readers
of this article have ever seen in one
spot the yearly output of his State legislature
or Congress? How many readers
who have discussed Congressional appropriations
have ever seen an appropriation
bill or part of one? How many readers
who have discussed tariff and finance have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
ever seen a real live tariff bill reposing in
the pages of the statutes of the United
States? I always take Ash’s edition of the
charter of New York City&mdash;a portly volume
of about a thousand pages&mdash;into my class
room and perform before the eyes of the
students the experiment of running through
the chief titles. It helps to keep them
modest in their estimate of their knowledge
of our city government, and it is a standing
apology for the innumerable question which
I fail to answer. I may mention, also, in
leaving this group, the State election law
which can be secured readily from the Secretary
of the Commonwealth, and should
be always in hand.</p>

<p>IV. The fourth group includes the literature
of current and party politics, vast,
fugitive, here to-day and gone to-morrow,
but of an importance never imagined by
students who have staked their hopes on
understanding our system by a study of
“The Federalist.” Party platforms, national,
State, and local, campaign text-books,
campaign speeches; broadsides, cartoons,
posters, and handbills; pamphlets
published by partisan and non-partisan associations;
interviews in the press; articles
in magazines, and a thousand other devices
by which political issues are raised and
public consciousness aroused, ought to be
watched with close scrutiny by the teacher
of government faithful to his calling. A
collection of ballots should be made showing
what the voter has to do on election
day, and copies of instructions to voters
should be filed away. A hundred other
things will be suggested at once to the alert
teacher, so that I need not continue the
catalogue, but will close the general appeal
“Back to the Sources.”</p>

<h2 id="Ref_50">The Recent Revolution in Turkey<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h2>


<p class="authorindent">BY JOHN HAYNES, PH.D.</p>

<p>For years the history of Turkey was a
monotonous tale of domestic disorder and
foreign intervention. There was endless
turmoil among the warring races and religions
of Macedonia, and from time to time
some dreadful outrage against the Armenians
of Asiatic Turkey. The nations of
Europe were constantly seeking reparation
for wrongs done to their citizens or urging
reforms for the benefit of the Sultan’s
Christian subjects. It seemed only a question
of time when Turkey would be blotted
from the map by the powers of Europe.</p>

<p>Suddenly in July, 1908, it was announced
that the constitution of 1876,
which was “suspended” after being in
force a short time, had been restored.
Only the party known as the Young Turks
were prepared for such an occurrence. For
thirty years they had labored for the overthrow
of the misrule of Sultan Abdul
Hamid II. Their headquarters had been in
Paris, but since 1904 they had been forming
revolutionary organizations in Turkey
under a central body called the Committee
of Union and Progress. The support of
the movement came from the professional
classes and from progressive officers in the
army, without whose help it could not have
succeeded. Some days before the proclamation
of the constitution, the Sultan learned
of disaffection in the army of European
Turkey, and vainly tried to quell it. Then
being informed that unless he granted a
constitution thirty thousand soldiers would
march upon Constantinople, he yielded. A
new ministry was formed under Kiamil
Pasha, and many of the tools of the Sultan
fled the country. In many cities there
were extravagant manifestations of rejoicing,
in which Moslems and Christians participated
together.</p>

<p>The constitution of 1876 is the work of
Midhat Pasha, the first Grand Vizier of
Abdul Hamid. It provides for personal
liberty, freedom of speech and of the press,
and equality of Moslems and Christians
before the law. The Parliament consists of
a Senate, whose members are appointed by
the Sultan, and a Chamber of Deputies
chosen by the people indirectly through
electors. Under this constitution a parliament
was chosen and opened in December
by the Sultan in person.</p>

<p>For a time all seemed to go well, but
Abdul Hamid was plotting for the overthrow
of the new régimé which had been
forced upon him. The first sign of this was
the appointment of two ministers suspected
of being hostile to the progressive program.
The Chamber of Deputies voted want of
confidence in the ministry, and Hilmi Pasha
was made Grand Vizier in accordance with
the wish of the Young Turks, who thus
imposed a new ministry upon the sovereign
after the manner of the British House
of Commons. But this did not end the
matter. For months the Sultan’s money
had been corrupting the army, and in April,
1909, the troops in Constantinople mutinied,
declaring the Young Turks tyrants. Tewfik
Pasha, a reactionary, was put at the
head of the ministry. At the same time
terrible massacres of Christians, believed to
have been inspired by the Sultan, took place
in Adana and vicinity.</p>

<p>But this counter-revolution was short-lived.
The Macedonian division of the army
under Chevket Pasha soon marched upon
Constantinople, took the city without
serious opposition, occupied the royal palace
(Yiediz Kiosk), and made the Sultan a
prisoner. Abdul Hamid was formally deposed
by decree of the Sheik-ul-Islam, the religious
head of the Moslems, and the action was
confirmed by the Parliament. A brother,
who by Turkish law, was the heir apparent,
was chosen in his place, and now rules as
Mehmet V. Hilmi Pasha was restored as
Grand Vizier. Many participants in the
counter revolution were executed. The new
Sultan, who was sixty-four at his accession,
has lived the secluded life of a political
prisoner.</p>

<p>The future of Turkey is almost as much
a problem as it was before this remarkable
revolution. The Young Turks, who are now
in power, stand for internal reform and
the integrity of the empire. But they have
to face the fact that the great majority
of Moslems are reactionary, and that their
power is dependent on the support of the
army. The people as a whole are not fitted
for self-government. One of the charges
brought against Abdul Hamid was that the
Turkish dominions were dismembered during
his reign, but since the revolution of
July, 1908, Turkey has lost its nominal
sovereignty over Bulgaria and Bosnia and
Herzegovina. She has also been on the
point of losing her small hold on Crete.
Though there are Christians in the Parliament
and two in the cabinet, the Young
Turks do not have the complete co-operation
of the Christian population, many of
whom will never be satisfied while any of
Europe remains under Turkish rule. Besides,
their sincerity as protectors of the
Christians is doubted. The action of the
court martial on the Adana massacres is
not satisfactory. Few Moslems have been
severely dealt with. Scores of Christian
girls, who were carried away as booty during
the massacres, have not been returned
to their families nor their captors punished.
The Patriarch of the Armenian
Catholic Church declares that the Young
Turks propose to make the Christians give
up their educational institutions and send
their children to Turkish schools. The
greater part of the foreigners resident at
Constantinople, while sympathetic with the
new order, are not confident of the future.
On the other hand, there are persons thoroughly
conversant with Turkish affairs who
feel sure that a new day of freedom and
progress has really dawned. The future
only can tell.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_51">Proposals of the Committee of Eight</h2>


<p class="authorindent">A RESTATEMENT BY JAMES ALTON JAMES, OF NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,
CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE.</p>

<p>Teachers of history, the country over,
have for the past ten years been grateful
that the American Historical Association assumed
that history for the secondary schools
offered problems in which its members were
vitally interested. In all of our schools to-day
some effect of the revolution wrought
by the report of the Committee of Seven may
be observed. It was not going far afield,
then, when the same association, observing
the heterogeneous condition existing
also in the presentation of history in the
elementary schools, should have proffered
some assistance. At the Chicago meeting of
the association, therefore, teachers of history
from elementary and high schools,
from normal schools and colleges, were invited
to a conference on the topics: (1)
Some suggestions for a course of study in
history for the elementary schools; and (2)
the preparation most desirable for the
teacher of history in these schools. Following
the discussion, the resolution was
adopted that it was deemed desirable that
a committee should be appointed to make
out a program in history for the elementary
schools and consider other closely-allied
topics. In response, the Committee of Eight
was selected to consider the problems suggested
and prepare a report. Care was
exercised in making up the committee to
secure a majority who should be in actual
touch with the work of the elementary
schools. As originally composed, the committee
consisted of three superintendents
of schools, two teachers in normal schools,
and two from the colleges. It cannot be
said, therefore, that the report finally presented
after four years of labor is the result
of the working out of fine-drawn theories
on the part of college men.</p>

<p>In fashioning the report, present conditions
were kept steadily in mind. Looking
towards some uniformity in the program
for history in our elementary schools, due
praise must always be accorded to the report
of the Madison Conference on History,
Civil Government and Economics, which
was published in 1893, and to the supplementary
report of the Committee of Seven.
In these reports we find the first significant
declarations that history is entitled to
a place of dignity in all secondary and
elementary school programs. Some two
hundred superintendents of schools in different
parts of the country have submitted
for the consideration of the committee
what they believed to be the best programs,
and many elementary history teachers have
been consulted on various features of the
report. Opportunity for discussing the
most important phases was given in a number
of teachers’ associations in various sections
of the country. Through these letters
and discussions the committee has obtained
many practical suggestions.</p>

<p>The committee has attempted to present
a plan of study which would bring about
concerted endeavor, avoid duplication of
work in the several grades, and produce
unity of purpose. To this end, our fundamental
proposition is, that history teaching
in the elementary schools should be focused
around American history. By this
we do not mean to imply that American
history has to do with events, alone, which
have occurred in America. The object is
to explain the civilization, the institutions,
and the traditions of the America of to-day.
America cannot be understood without taking
into account the history of its various
peoples before they crossed the Atlantic.
Indeed, too much emphasis has heretofore
been laid upon the Atlantic as a natural
boundary not merely of the American continent,
but also of the history of America.</p>

<p>The grouping of the subject matter for
the several grades is as follows: In the
first two grades, the object is to give the
child an impression of primitive life and
an appreciation of public holidays. To the
succeeding three grades is assigned the study
of great leaders and heroes; world heroes
in the third; American explorers and leaders
in America to the period of the Revolution
in the fourth; and leaders of the
national period in the fifth. In addition,
there should be noted the manners, customs,
and, so far as possible, the industries
of the various sections of the country at
the period under discussion.</p>

<p>The sixth grade, as outlined, will at first
glance present the greatest difficulties.
With full appreciation of this tendency, the
committee has carefully and at greater
length than for the other grades, defined its
position. It is recommended that there
should be presented to pupils of this grade
those features of ancient and medieval life
which explain either important elements of
our civilization or which show how the
movement for discovery and colonization
originated. A glance at the outline shows
that it is not intended that the topics
should be presented as organized history.
It goes without the saying that pupils in
this grade are not prepared to study scientific
history in its logical and orderly development.
But, as stated in the report,
they are prepared to receive more or less
definite impressions that may be conveyed
to them by means of pictures, descriptions,
and illustrative stories, arranged in chronological
sequence. In receiving such impressions,
they will not understand the full
meaning of the great events touched upon,
but they will catch something of the spirit
and purpose of the Greeks, the Romans, and
other types of racial life.</p>

<p>For the seventh grade, it is recommended
that the growth and settlement of the colonies
be taken up with enough of the European
background to explain events in
America having their causes in England or
Europe. Here should be considered also
the American Revolution.</p>

<p>The subject matter of the eighth grade
would include the inauguration of the new
government, the political, industrial and social
development of the United States, westward
expansion and a brief study of the
growth of the great rival states of Europe.</p>

<p>Is it not beyond dispute that much of our
teaching of history in the past has failed
of proper results for the reason that
pupils advancing from grade to grade
have been compelled to consider topics with
which they have grown familiar? Who has
not noted the deadening effect on the interest
of pupils, especially in the history
of our own country, where the prescribed
course found in many schools has been
faithfully followed, which provides a text
in elementary American history for the
fifth and sixth grades, succeeded by a
grammar school American history in the
next two grades? To secure continued interest,
it is advised that there be offered,
in each of the several years, one distinct
portion or section of our country’s history;
that this be presented with as much fulness
as possible and that the recurrence in
successive years of subject matter that has
once been outlined be avoided.</p>

<p>While the proper distribution of historical
subject matter is the prime feature
of the report, the committee would emphasize
the consideration of other items, such
as the outline presented for elementary lessons
on government; the training suitable
for the teacher; the correlation with geography
and literature, and the methods to be
employed.</p>

<p>In offering the report, we are aware that
a literal interpretation of some of its
phases would preclude its use in many of
our schools. But let it be borne in mind
that no one of us has for a moment assumed
that there is to be a <em>rigid</em> adherence
to <em>detail</em> in the minor sub-divisions of each
year’s work. If the report as a whole appeals
to teachers as pointing the way to
a practical solution for many of the problems
now encountered, then may we look
with confidence for more satisfying results
from our elementary history teaching, and
as a consequence expect more consideration
for the subject itself on the part of those
who control the making of school programs.</p>

<p class="authorindent">REPORT TO THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION BY THE COMMITTEE OF EIGHT<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="subtitleindent smallfont" style="font-weight:normal">REVIEWED BY SARAH A. DYNES, HEAD OF DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY IN NEW JERSEY STATE
NORMAL AND MODEL SCHOOLS, TRENTON, N. J.</p>

<p>The course of study in history for elementary
schools mapped out in the “Report
of the Committee of Eight” is an
attempt to secure by the aid of a national
organization some uniformity in the program
for history. The personnel of the
committee led us to expect an able report.
The specialist in American history, the specialist
in European history, and the specialist
in the pedagogy of history for elementary
grades were all represented. Three
superintendents of schools upon the committee
seemed to warrant us in anticipating
that the rights of other subjects in the
elementary curriculum would be guarded,
and that history would not be permitted to
absorb an undue proportion of the pupil’s
time. The presence of those closely associated
with elementary schools caused the
present actual condition of such schools to
be kept clearly in mind while the work proceeded.
Practical experience gained in dealing
with both the elementary teacher and
the elementary pupil led them to inquire at
each step whether a proposed change were
possible, while the experience of the specialists
in American history and in European
history naturally called attention to what
would be <em>desirable</em> from the standpoint of
subject-matter.</p>

<p>The committee presented a preliminary
report for consideration and frank discussion
at three different regular meetings of
the American Historical Association held at
Chicago, Baltimore and Providence respectively.
A report of what had been accomplished
by the committee at the close of its
second year of work, was presented to the
Department of Superintendents at a regular
meeting of the National Educational
Association for 1907. Certain features of
the report were also discussed at a regular
meeting of the History Teachers’ Association
of the Middle States and Maryland,
held in New York City. Suggested topics
of the report were discussed by the Chicago
History Teachers’ Association and by the
History Teachers’ Association of the North
Central States. From the foregoing it is
easily seen that there has been no undue
haste in arriving at conclusions. It will
be noted also that all experienced teachers
of history, and all superintendents who are
really interested in improving the quality
of the teaching of elementary history have
had abundant opportunity to contribute
toward the improvement of the proposed
course, and to object to that which seemed
visionary, impracticable, or unwise. Interest
in the report has been widespread during
the past three years, and it is gratifying
to know that it is now published in a
form which makes it accessible to all interested.</p>

<p>The course includes a series of organized
groups of topics for the first eight years of
school life. The most cursory examination
of the work suggested for the primary
grades brings to view these expressions:
(1) “Historical backgrounds, (2) Stories,
(3) Pictures, (4) Construction, (5) Teacher’s
list of books.” This is certainly encouraging.
It suggests mental pictures. It
emphasizes vivid impressions of concrete,
objective reality. Things are to be seen,
touched, used in new combinations. The
preparation of the teacher is to be in part
from <em>books</em>, not from <em>a book</em>. She is made
to feel that elementary history must be
picture-making, not word-getting. A closer
examination shows that there is no repetition
of subject-matter as the child passes
from grade to grade. This last feature
will be welcomed most heartily by the elementary
teacher of history. Nothing is
more gratifying than to have the entire
responsibility of teaching the topics assigned
to her own grade. If she is a fifth-grade
teacher, and is making her preparation
for teaching a biography of Daniel
Boone, she can look back through the topics
suggested by the committee to be taken up
in grades four, three, two and one, and
congratulate herself that no other teacher
has touched that topic. It is her privilege
to introduce this hero with the fullest
assurance that there is no danger of trespassing
upon the territory of another. If,
at the close of the work, the pupils of the
fifth grade have a vivid picture of life on
the border, if they have been led to sympathize
with the dangers, the trials, the
hardships of frontier life, and have gained
an impression of the importance of Daniel
Boone’s service to his fellow men, she has
done a creditable piece of work. If they
are bewildered, mystified, confused and
glad to leave the subject, she has no one
to blame but herself. By noting what has
been done in the four preceding grades, she
has reason to expect a certain amount of
skill on the part of pupils in construction
work. The pupils have already built
wigwams, and that will make it easier for
them to make a hunter’s camp, or to draw a
representation of a cabin on the cattle
range, or of the fort at Boonesborough.
They have had practice in interpreting pictures
and in finding pictures; they have had
experience with sand-tables and in clay
modeling and in making costumes; they
have been reproducing stories and anecdotes,
and taking part in discussions; consequently,
she can expect a vocabulary in
which there is a meaning and significance
attached to the words used. What has
been illustrated in the case of Daniel Boone
is as true of any other topic. Some topics
are to be taught in more than one grade,
but in each case the committee has carefully
planned to avoid overlapping and prevent
repetition.</p>

<p>In the fifth grade the topics are organized
into twelve groups, lettered A to L inclusive,
with from three to five sub-topics in a
group. The following selections show the
general scope of the work outlined: Group
D is “The Great West,” and Daniel
Boone is one of the sub-topics to be taught
in that group. Group E, “The Northwest,”
contains the story of George Rogers Clark
as one of the sub-topics. Group G, “Increasing
the Size of the New Republic,”
contains the story of Lewis and Clark.
Group L, “Great Industries,” contains the
following stories:</p>

<p>Cotton&mdash;the cotton fields; the factory.</p>

<p>Wheat&mdash;the wheat field; grain elevators.</p>

<p>Cattle&mdash;cattle-grazing; stockyards.</p>

<p>Coal and Iron&mdash;the mines; the furnaces;
the products.</p>

<p>In addition to these biographical stories
selected from the field of American history,
the committee suggests that twenty minutes
a week for one-half of the year should
be devoted to the study of civics. The following
are suggested topics to be discussed:
“The Fire Department,” “The Police Department,”
“The Post-office System,”
“Street Cleaning and Sprinkling,” “Public
Libraries.” The committee, in a table given
on page 126, shows how a place may be
made on the program in each grade for the
study of history. That program provides
only one recitation per week in the first
three grades. In the fourth and fifth grades
there would be two recitations a week.
The work suggested in the report for the
first five grades could be easily accomplished
in the time stated in the program.</p>

<p>The committee suggests that a text-book
be placed in the hands of the pupils in
grades six, seven and eight, but emphasizes
the necessity of oral work in the first five
grades. They also advise the continuation
of much oral work in the sixth grade. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
subject-matter of the sixth grade includes
such portions of European history as bear
most directly on American history. The
topics selected for study are organized into
six groups, lettered A to F inclusive. Counting
one recitation as the unit of measurement
in estimating the relative amount of
time to be devoted to each group, the committee
estimates the relative importance of
the groups thus: Groups F and C have thirteen
units each; group E has twelve; group
B has seven; group A has five; group D
only three. This manner of indicating the
relative importance of the groups will be
of great value to the inexperienced teacher.
The committee also wisely suggests “what
not to attempt” in this grade. The greater
portion of the pupil’s time in the sixth
grade is to be spent upon the following
topics: “Alfred and the English”; “How
the English Began to Win Their Liberties”;
“The Discovery of the Western
World”; “European Rivalries Which Influenced
Conquest and Colonization.” In
this grade also there is to be instruction in
civics for one-half year, twenty minutes a
week. A list of topics suggested includes
the following: “Water Supply and Sewerage
System”; “The Board of Health”;
“Juvenile Courts.” The program (p. 126)
previously referred to provides three recitations
per week in history for the sixth
grade.</p>

<p>The topics of the seventh grade are organized
into six groups, all of which are
connected with the exploration and settlement
of North America and the growth of
the colonies, to the close of the Revolutionary
War. Enough of the European background
to make clear the significance of certain
situations in America is included. The
group headings are as follows:</p>

<p>A&mdash;“The First Settlements (in America)
of the Three Rivals of Spain.”</p>

<p>B&mdash;“Exiles for Political or Religious
Causes.”</p>

<p>C&mdash;“Colonial Rivalries.”</p>

<p>D&mdash;“Growth of the English Colonies.”</p>

<p>E&mdash;“Struggle for Colonial Empire between
England and France.”</p>

<p>F&mdash;“From Colonies to Commonwealth.”</p>

<p>The topics in civics are those that grow
naturally out of the instruction in history,
such as an explanation of our search warrant
in connection with a study of the
writs of assistance, and in addition, topics
of this character: “State Charities,” “State
Schools,” “State Penal Institutions,” “National
Parks,” “Preservation of Forests,”
“Construction of Roads, Canals, Harbors.”
These topics in civics are to be covered in
a time allowance of forty minutes a week
for the entire year. The number of recitations
in history indicated in this grade is
eighty-seven (87), of which the last group,
F, has 34, and A has only 5; B has 18;
C and D have 11 each; E has 8. The work
for the eighth grade begins with the constitutional
period of American history, and
closes with the problems which confront our
nation to-day, due to our rapid industrial
development, commercial rivalry, and our
recent annexations. These topics are organized
into seven main groups, as follows:</p>

<p>A&mdash;“Organization of the United States.”</p>

<p>B&mdash;“The New Republic and Revolution in Europe.”</p>

<p>C&mdash;“Industrial and Social Development.”</p>

<p>D&mdash;“New Neighbors and New Problems.”</p>

<p>E&mdash;“Expansion Makes the Slavery Question
Dominant.”</p>

<p>F&mdash;“The Crisis of the Republic.”</p>

<p>G&mdash;“The New Union and the Larger Europe.”</p>

<p>The committee suggests the relative
amount of time to be devoted to each sub-topic
in this grade. Ninety-four recitation
periods are required to cover the work outlined,
19 of which are given to F, 16 to B,
15 to G; C and D have 12 each, and A and
E have 10 each. The committee also suggests
that an average of sixty minutes a
week be devoted to civics in this grade, and
that a text-book in civics, as well as a text-book
in history, be placed in the hands of
each pupil. The function of city, State and
national government should be emphasized,
rather than the machinery of each. The
actual work of the government to-day, and
concrete instances of civic duty should be
discussed, and a special study of such topics
as “Child Labor,” “Corruption in Politics,”
“Best Methods of Work in Local City Governments,”
is advised.</p>

<p>Fifteen pages are devoted to a discussion
of the preparation of the teacher. The suggestions
offered are helpful, and in accordance
with the best educational theories.
The entire chapter, though brief, shows
clearly the need of special preparation, if a
teacher hopes to make a success of her
work. The entire book is a teacher’s book.
The outlines given are not for the class-room;
they are to serve as a suggestion to
the teacher, who will make her own outlines,
based upon the principles laid down in
the report, and dealing with the phases of
subject-matter which the committee selected.
No attempt has been made to go
beyond what is already being done in the
best schools of the country. The committee
has tried to show what is possible in
elementary grades. The report will doubtless
tend to improve the work in the less
favored sections of the country. The plan
of work presented is a very definite and
carefully-considered plan, which is certainly
entitled to a fair trial on its merits.</p>

<h3>Outline for Oral Lessons on Westward Immigration.</h3>

<p class="center boldfont" style="margin-top:-1em">(Adapted to the Third or Fourth Grade.)</p>

<p>1. The Western Country and How It was
Reached&mdash;Virginians and their neighbors
moved oftener than the colonists to the
north. Attracted by “mineral springs,”
“salt licks” and “blue grass.” Buffalo
paths converge at Cumberland Gap. Wilderness
Road, two hundred miles long, from
Virginia through this gap to Kentucky,
made by Daniel Boone in charge of thirty
men. At first only a narrow path for horsemen
and footmen. Pack saddles, how made
and used.</p>

<p>2. Daniel Boone, “Columbus of the Land.”&mdash;Born
in Pennsylvania, father settled in
Wilkes County, North Carolina, when
Daniel was about 13 years old. Early life
on frontier farm, used gun almost as early
as hoe. Little log home. Married at 20;
five years later he decided to move, wanted
“elbow room.” “If these people keep coming,
soon there will not be a bar in all this
country.” Prospecting trip across the mountains,
with two or three backwoodsmen at
the time of the French and Indian War. Up
a tree to escape from a bear. “D. Boone
cilled a bar on this tree in 1760” on a
beech tree in Eastern Tennessee.</p>

<p>3. New Homes in the Wilderness&mdash;Nine
years after killing the bear in Tennessee
he went to Kentucky to find a new home.
Wild game, deer, bear, buffaloes, wolves.
Shelter of logs open on one side. “Dark
and Bloody Ground.” Indian tricks, imitating
turkeys and owls. “Killed” a “stump.”
Captured by Indians. Escape after seven
days. Alone in the wilderness, 500 miles
from home. Forty new settlers from North
Carolina. Capture of Boone’s daughter and
two other girls by Indians and their rescue.
Elizabeth Kane and the grapevine swing.
Boone a prisoner in Detroit. Indians refuse
$500 for him. His escape. Removal to Missouri.
Death and burial at Frankfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>4. A Frontier Home&mdash;Log cabin in a clearing
near the fort. Ladder against wall for
stairway and pegs in wall for clothing.
Rough boards supported by four wooden
pegs for dining table. Dirt floor.</p>

<p>5. Life of a Pioneer Boy&mdash;Taught to imitate
notes and calls of birds and wild animals,
to set traps and to shoot the rifle.
At 12 he became a fort soldier, with a porthole
assigned to him. Taught to follow an
Indian trail and to conceal his own when
on the warpath.</p>

<p>6. Suggested Topics for Other Lessons:</p>

<p class="itemparens">(1) The Story of James Robertson.</p>

<p class="itemparens">(2) The Story of John Sevier.</p>

<p class="itemparens">(3) The Story of George Rogers Clark.</p>

<p class="itemparens">(4) Stories of the French in America
and the Struggle for the Mississippi
Valley.</p>

<p>7. Bibliography&mdash;Gordy’s “American
Leaders and Heroes” (Charles Scribner’s
Sons); McMurry’s “Pioneers of the Mississippi
Valley” and Hart’s “Source Reader in
American History,” No. 3, and Eggleston’s
“Stories of Great Americans” and “First
Book in American History” (A. B. Co.);
Catherwood’s “Heroes of the Middle West,”
and Blaisdell and Ball’s “Hero Stories from
American History” (Ginn &amp; Co.); Aunt
Charlotte’s “Stories of American History”
(D. Appleton &amp; Co.).</p>


<h3>Methods of Primary Instruction.</h3>

<p>1. Oral presentation. These stories should
be given by the teacher in a simple, animated
style, adapted to the mental status
of the child. They should abound in narration
rather than description. Children like
action. During the first two years they
should be related rather than read.</p>

<p>2. Illustrations. Frequent use should be
made of blackboard illustrations. Printed
pictures, objects, etc., should also be used.</p>

<p>3. Construction. Children should do constructive
work along lines suggested by the
lessons&mdash;draw pictures, make log houses,
bows, arrows, wigwams, etc.</p>

<p>4. Reproduction. The stories should be
frequently repeated by the pupil until they
are thoroughly mastered. They should also
be reproduced in written form as soon as
the child is sufficiently advanced.</p>

<p>5. Note books. The children should copy
their stories after they have been corrected
into their history note books. Neatness
should be emphasized.</p>

<p>6. Memory work. The children should
memorize historical poems and brief extracts
from historical literature, which are
thoroughly comprehensible to them.</p>

<p>7. Reading. The children should be encouraged
to acquire new facts for themselves
from books that are easily comprehensible
to them.</p>

<p>8. Reviews. There should be frequent reviews.
These exercises should be varied
as much as possible and should be often
held at unexpected times. Call on different
members of the class to tell of their favorite
characters; give characteristic incidents
not already related, in the life of a person,
and let the children guess who it is; let
them guess what certain pictures represent,
etc.</p>

<p>9. Rewards. The child should be occasionally
rewarded with something to read
about his favorite character. Reward the
mind, but do not permit it to be surfeited.</p>

<p>10. Problems. In the latter part of the
primary course special attention should be
given to historical problems. See McMurry’s
“Special Method in History,” pp. 66-74.</p>


<h3>Suggestions on Primary History.</h3>

<p>1. Have the purpose and outline of the
story well in hand before presenting it, and
let your presentation be independent of the
book. The outline of your story should be
very carefully prepared.</p>

<p>2. Avoid complex details. Tell story
vividly. “The educational value of these
stories does not depend upon literal accuracy.”</p>

<p>3. The sequence of events and their relations
are more important than dates. “A
long time ago” means more to a child than
1492.</p>

<p>4. Lay special stress on ethical teaching;
cut down wars and military campaigns as
much as possible.</p>

<p>5. Go slowly. Haste is a poor policy. A
teacher may sometimes devote weeks to a
single character to advantage. Do not cram
facts indiscriminately into children’s minds.</p>

<p>6. Do not repeat stories to the same children
from year to year.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_54">A Type Lesson for the Grades</h2>


<p class="authorindent">BY ARMAND J. GERSON.</p>

<p class="subtitleindent">THE SPANISH CLAIM.<br />
A Type Lesson.</p>

<p>Of the many complaints made by history
teachers in secondary schools regarding
preparation given in the grades perhaps
none contains a greater amount of truth
than the oft-repeated statement that while
pupils leave our elementary schools with a
large stock of historical terms and
phrases they often lack a real grasp of their
significance. I know of a pupil who after
a whole year of Sixth Grade work defined
tax as “money that is paid for tea,” and
who honestly thought that George III’s
ministers were “a sort of clergymen.”
Still more frequent are the instances where
the pupil’s notions of terms used are so
hazy and inadequate as not to admit of
definition at all.</p>

<p>This condition may be variously explained.
The trouble is often caused by an
improper use of the text-book, the incompetent
teacher resting content if the pupil
commits the words on the pages and recites
them with some semblance of intelligence.
In most cases, however, it is safe to say that
the misconceptions are the result of the
teacher’s failure to grasp the child’s difficulties,
his inability to put himself into the
pupil’s place and realize the mental equipment
which the child brings to the grasping
of the new ideas. Be the cause of the difficulty
what it may, the recognition of its
existence must be the first step toward its
removal.</p>

<p>The word “claim” occupies a prominent
place among the disturbers of the peace. In
the course of the history work the children
become familiar with the fact that the voyages
and explorations of the Spanish, English,
French and Dutch somehow give rise to
“land claims” whose overlapping results in
interesting international conflicts. Judicious
questioning, however, is apt to disclose
a surprising lack of definiteness as to
the meaning of this word “claim.” In
accordance with the type-lesson method
this vagueness of comprehension might
readily be avoided if the “claim” concept
were developed thoroughly in connection
with the explorations of a single European
nation. In other words, the teaching of a
typical claim forms the surest sort of basis
for the comprehension of land claims in
general. Spain, because of the early date
of its explorations, naturally suggests
itself as the type. Let the pupil understand
intensively all that we can teach him about
the Spanish claim&mdash;how far it extended, on
what it was based, what it meant&mdash;and
there will be no difficulty when we come to
develop the claims of England, France and
Holland.</p>

<p>In presenting the type lesson on the
Spanish claim the teacher must carefully
distinguish and strongly emphasize the
type-elements, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i>, those aspects of the
subject which help form a clear concept or
pattern. Chief among these type-elements
may be mentioned the following: A clear
understanding of what we mean by “right
of discovery;” some notion of the distance
a claim may be said to extend beyond the
point or coast explored; a definite comprehension
of what is meant when we speak of
a nation “owning” land; a mental attitude
toward the rights of the original inhabitants.
Reference to these fundamentals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
will have to be made repeatedly
when the claims of other European nations
are in their turn presented to the class,
but this mere reference is all that will be
required if the type-elements developed in
connection with the Spanish claim have been
thoroughly grounded. The particular incidents
of the Spanish story, pedagogically
speaking, are of less fundamental significance.</p>

<p>In connection with the Columbus story
the class will have been brought to see that
the chief political consequence of that event
consisted in the extension of Spanish dominion.
“For Castile and Leon Columbus
discovered a New World” contains an
ethical principle immediately recognized by
every boy of ten. This principle contains
the essence of the whole theory of discovery
and exploration, and should, for a time at
least, be allowed to remain undisputed. It
might be well even to reinforce this theory
by reference to the widely accepted principle
applied by our boys and girls in their
everyday life,&mdash;“finding is keeping.” Ownership
of what we find may indeed be disputed
by others, but the finder may at
least be said to have a “claim” to it. It
is in this sense that Spain had a “claim”
to the New World.</p>

<p>But a nation’s claim to newly discovered
land is in many ways different from a
boy’s claim to a marble he has found. First
of all, the boy has probably picked up the
whole marble and put it in his pocket.
The Spanish explorers, on the other hand,
only caught glimpses of part of the edge
of a great continent. Had they a good
claim to the whole continent or could they
only claim the parts they had found?
Difference of opinion on this point is very
possible and may give rise to profitable
class discussion. Ignorance of the size and
shape of the continent, concentration of
Spanish interest in the south, and the decree
of Pope Alexander should all be pointed
out as determining elements in the gradual
defining of the Spanish claim. The work
of each of the Spanish explorers should
be reviewed in this connection, and the
claim finally located on the map.</p>

<p>It is important, in the next place, that
the pupils should devote some thought to
the question of what we mean when we
say Spain “owned” Florida, Mexico, etc.
In this connection attention may well be
called to the theory of government generally
held in the sixteenth century. The
modern notion of government existing for
the sake of the governed had scarcely taken
form in the minds of men. The nations of
Europe were avowedly selfish. Spain
“owned” America in the sense that she
could make laws for its people, dispose of
its territory, and control its resources.</p>

<p>Finally, a complete notion of European
claims to the New World must perforce
include some reference to the rights of the
natives. The comparative rights of the
natives and Europeans is fortunately not a
question upon which we are called upon to
pronounce a verdict. As an element in all
colonizing activities it requires our attention,
however, and it certainly affords admirable
opportunity for cultivating our
pupils’ human sympathies.</p>

<p>Reference should be made to the pre-eminence
of the Spanish claim on the score
of priority. It is to be borne in mind that
our type-lesson, besides forming the basis
for the teaching of subsequent claims, will
have still greater significance when the
conflict of European nations leads to the
great international struggle for the New
World. Constant reference to maps and
charts, and, more important still, the making
of claim maps by the pupils themselves,
constitute an obvious, but none the less
essential, means of rendering definite and
permanent the results of the “claim” lesson.
A progressive map upon which the
conflict of claims could be developed will
be of particular value.</p>

<p>Our endeavor throughout the Spanish
claim lesson should be to proceed as slowly
and carefully as possible. Much of the
detail presented need not be retained as
such, but will serve its most useful purpose
by forming a setting for the salient points.
The aim of the type-lesson is to construct
a firm and sure foundation for later work.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_55">The Hudson-Fulton Celebration</h2>


<p>From the 25th of September, when the
Half-Moon and the Clermont left their
temporary berths in the Kill van Kill, in
Staten Island, to October 9th, when they
reached the city of Troy, the people of the
city and the State of New York devoted
themselves with remarkable singleness of
purpose to the celebration of two historical
incidents of world-wide importance: the discovery
of the river by Henry Hudson in
1609 and the successful completion of the
first steamboat voyage up the river to
Albany in 1807. For months before, laymen
and professional historians and history
teachers had been busy preparing for the
celebration, and the result of their work
was to be seen in the parades and pageants.
Circulars, instructions, maps, pictures, and
even historical treatises, succeeded each
other in almost endless succession. Of
them all, the pamphlet issued by the State
Department of Education, entitled “Hudson-Fulton
Celebration, 1609-1807-1909,”
and the printed circular issued by the New
York City Department of Education, entitled
“Hudson-Fulton Celebration&mdash;Suggestions
for Exercises,” are especially recommended
to teachers who are looking for
suggestions as to plans for similar celebrations.
Both can be had by application
to the proper authorities.</p>

<p>The parades and pageants which marked
the week’s celebration in New York City
have been so thoroughly described in the
newspapers and reviews that it would be
useless to discuss them once again in this
connection. From the point of view of the
teacher, the naval parade of Saturday, September
25th, the historical parade of Tuesday,
September 28th, and the school commemorative
exercises of Wednesday, September
29th, and Saturday, October 2d,
were the most important and the most significant.
Though none of these was perfect
in all its details, still all of them gave to
the children of the city opportunities for
visualizing conditions as they existed in the
past such as no other method could have
done. Pages and pages of description, for
instance, could give the child no such idea
of the difficulties of navigation in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries as the brief
view of the top-heavy, clumsy and poorly-constructed
model of the Half-Moon did.
More valuable still were the exercises,
largely in the form of dramatization, in
which the children of every grade, from
the kindergarten to the last year of the
high school, participated, both on Wednesday
morning and on Saturday afternoon.
Here the work was the result of the children’s
own constructive imagination, aided
and directed by skilled teachers and historians.
Once again, as far as possible, the
children were allowed to relive their lives
under conditions which approximated those
which surrounded their predecessors during
the last three centuries.</p>

<p>As to the permanent results of the celebration,
it may be said, first, that New
York City and New York State are to-day
richer than they would otherwise have been
in historical monuments and commemorative
tablets which are of constant educational
value. Further, both the city and
the State have been stirred to an extraordinary
pitch of civic pride and civic
activity and in both the children have participated
largely. What the past has accomplished
has been thoroughly emphasized;
what the future demands has by no means
been neglected. The lesson has thus been
both historical and political. As a model
for other cities this celebration will long
stand preëminent. Though there were many
errors and many shortcomings, other communities
will, nevertheless, find in the exercises
and in the pageants much to copy
that was valuable. Though the time and
energy expended were great, the results
were commensurate.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_56">EDITORIAL POLICY.</h2>


<p>It is not the purpose of the editors of the
<span class="smcap">Magazine</span> to espouse any particular pedagogical
policy. Articles may appear in the
paper which advocate new policies or radical
changes of method in the school or college
curriculum; but such papers express the
views of the contributors only, and not
necessarily of the editorial staff of the
paper. Rather it is their wish to make the
paper a mirror of the best thought and
practice in the profession, and to this end
they will welcome correspondence and contributions
upon all phases of questions
arising in the teaching of history. Let us
have a frank and full discussion of the
problems facing the teacher, and of the best
way of solving the problems; not fads or
hobbies, but sound experience and strong
pedagogical ideals. The editors invite the
coöperation of their readers in making the
paper a “clearing-house for ideas in the
profession.”</p>


<h3>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HISTORY.</h3>

<p>It may be a matter of surprise that a
paper devoted largely to the interests of
teachers of history in secondary schools and
colleges should print in one number nearly
five pages of matter relating to history in
elementary schools. Yet there should be no
need of an apology. Were not the several
parts of the American educational system
so independent of one another, our secondary
and college teachers of history would
not pride themselves upon their ignorance
of conditions in the elementary schools.
Because organically or politically there is
little correlation among the three parts of
the system, each part attempts to ignore
the others, rejecting suggestions concerning
its own work, and grudgingly and condescendingly
giving advice concerning the
others. With a few notable exceptions, several
of whom appear as contributors to this
number of the <span class="smcap">Magazine</span>, college men in
America have kept sedulously away from
the problems of history teaching in the
elementary school, or if they have turned
their gaze upon the schools, it has been to
seek a market for a new elementary history
textbook.</p>

<p>Yet the elementary school needs the best
thought that the nation can give to it; not
the thought of elementary school men alone,
but the clearness and directness and thoroughness
which come so frequently with
college training. It is superciliousness or
inertia which leads a college instructor to
say that he cannot realize the problems of
the elementary school, and then to send his
children to a class taught by a young girl
fresh from the normal school or high school.
It was not thus that the schedules for history
in the Prussian or French schools were
made. It is not by thus leaving the determination
of policy to weaker employees
that great corporations succeed. And how
much more valuable are our children than
corporate wealth!</p>

<p>The report of the Committee of Eight is
beyond doubt the most important feature
of the year in the teaching of history in
America. It deserves to rank with the report
of the Committee of Seven, and its
influence may well be even greater. The
report is remarkable for its sanity, its absence
of theorizing, its understanding of the
mind of the child at several ages, its clearness
and general helpfulness. Not content
with merely outlining the field of history
for each grade, the committee has realized
the weakness of the teacher, and has constructed
a course of study for her, and has
even gone so far as to advise the emphasis
and amount of time to be given to each
subject. Schedule-makers have previously
had no advice from historians upon these
points; they have been left severely alone
to fix their days and hours and subjects as
they might think best. The report changes
all this by combining the scholarly knowledge
of the historian with the skill of the
pedagogical student and with the worldly
wisdom of the schedule maker.</p>

<p>Of particular significance and originality
is the arrangement of topics by years in
such a manner that the student receives
something new in each grade. Even although
all the work centers about the history
of the United States, yet there is no
deadening repetition year after year. The
topics are carefully selected for each grade
with a view to increasing difficulty with the
advancing years of the student. Perhaps no
one feature of the report marks a more distinct
advance than this arrangement.</p>

<p>Not only should the report have a strong
influence upon the arrangement of the elementary
history course, but it should also
lead to a great improvement in the instruction
of history. Not every teacher can meet
the requirements set by the committee; the
result will be a wider adoption of the
“group” or “department” system, by
which the teacher is given charge of one
subject or of a group of allied topics, such
as English and history, or geography and
nature study. Such a division of labor is
in accord with the tendencies of the day;
it is in the interests of superior work in all
subjects; and it means increased mental
development not for the child alone, but for
the teacher as well. The report would deserve
a hearty welcome if it did no more
than advance the cause of the departmental
or group teacher.</p>

<p>It will do much more than this. It will
add dignity to the work in history; it will
give school administrators an ideal of work
in the subject; and best of all, it will give
the children of the nation a course in history
which will be stimulating and of
definite cultural value. Teachers of history
and school administrators should unite to
see that the new plan is given a fair test
under the best possible circumstances.
High school and college teachers should join
with elementary teachers in endorsing this
plan for raising the standard of history
teaching in America.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_57a">Readings in Government and Politics</h2>


<p class="authorindent">PROFESSOR BEARD’S WORK REVIEWED BY JOHN HAYNES, PH.D., DORCHESTER HIGH SCHOOL,
BOSTON, MASS.</p>

<p>This volume is an attempt to do for the
student of Government what the source
book does for the student of History. Prof.
Beard has prepared it primarily to be used
with his own “American Government and
Politics,” which is now in preparation, but
of course it can be used with any text-book
on the subject. The selections include
materials of many kinds, among them most
of the Federal Constitution (groups of
clauses bearing upon the same subject being
given at the beginning of the appropriate
chapter), parts of the constitutions of various
States, decisions of the Federal Supreme
Court and other courts of last resort,
arguments made in Congress, State legislatures,
constitutional conventions and political
meetings, party platforms, letters, laws,
treaties and proclamations. The Declaration
of Independence and the Articles of Confederation
are given in full. Each selection is
preceded by a brief introduction of a few
lines which is admirable in giving a succinct
statement of the main point or points of
the document which follows.</p>

<p>The wide scope of the selections, both as
to subjects and the sources from which they
are taken, is a testimony to the generous
amount of labor bestowed upon the preparation
of the volume. On the whole, admirable
judgment has been used in choosing
the material. Still some things are
absent which one might expect to find. The
case of McCulloch vs. Maryland is very
properly quoted at some length, but the
famous Dartmouth College case, whose consequences
were very important, is not
cited. The book would be improved by the
addition of selections designed to illustrate
judicial procedure, like a charge to a jury,
a declaration in a civil suit or an indictment.
Examples of different forms of ballots
might well be given, especially of the
ballot used in Oregon when laws are submitted
to popular vote.</p>

<p>The selections, which as far as possible
are taken from the writings of men who
have had practical experience in the conduct
of government, have the great merit
of giving a view of government as it really
is. The seamy side is not hidden. There
are documents illustrating the corruption
of the police, the tyranny of the boss, the
iniquities of the gerrymander, senatorial
courtesy, corporations in politics and the
unjust assessment of taxable property.</p>

<p>A great excellence of this book is its
being up to date. Examples of this are
selections from the Oregon law on the election
of United States Senators, from Oklahoma’s
Constitution, from the “Report of
the Boston Finance Commission,” issued in
1909, and the “Report of the Minnesota
Tax Commission” of the preceding year.</p>

<p>This volume, which is admirably adapted
to its purpose, is a distinct addition to the
resources of the teacher of Government.
While the average teacher is likely to be
more hampered by the entirely inadequate
time allowed for the subject than by lack
of good material, a contribution like this
of Professor Beard tends to dignify the
subject, which is all too likely to be treated
as a tail to the history kite, and to secure
for it the place which it deserves in school
courses.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_57b">Civics and Health</h2>


<p class="authorindent">DR. ALLEN’S WORK REVIEWED BY LOUIS NUSBAUM.</p>

<p>Dr. Allen has presented a work which
in the directness, forcefulness and logic of
its appeal for good health as a civic duty
makes the book worthy to be considered
as epoch-making. To quote Dr. Allen’s
thought, changed conditions of social and
industrial life have virtually eliminated
from present-day politics the inalienable
rights for which our ancestors fought and
died, and in their stead has come the need
to formulate rules which will insure to
every citizen the economic and industrial
rights essential to twentieth century happiness.
And just as community of interest
was the incentive to attaining those political
rights in the past, so united action is
necessary to secure health rights.</p>

<p>Scarcely any phase of the question of
public health is left untouched in this interesting
little book. From the consideration
of sound teeth as a commercial asset,
through the discussion of a long list of preventable
and removable diseases and disorders,
to the examination of tuberculosis
as an industrial loss, Dr. Allen has made
out so strong a case against the social
losses due to disease, that one is necessarily
aroused to a new sense of public
duty. And it is in this very awakening of
a slumbering public consciousness that the
book will do its most effective work. As
Prof. William T. Sedgwick says in his introduction,
a reading of the chapter headings
merely “will cause surprise and rejoicing.”</p>

<p>The facts of the existence of the health
conditions revealed in this book are not
new, but the immensity of these known
conditions, as successively enumerated here,
is almost astounding. For a brief moment
in reading the book one is led to feel that
it is the work of an extremist or enthusiast,
to be discounted in effect for a certain
measure of high coloring, yet a careful
inspection reveals the fact that everything
is told in an honest and direct, even
if at times dogmatic, way.</p>

<p>Unlike the work of many pseudo-reformers,
Dr. Allen’s book is comprehensive in
its scope in that it not only reveals existing
conditions, but it indicates how these
conditions may be remedied and tells of
the efforts thus far made to apply the
proper remedies. After pointing out that
the best index to community health is the
physical welfare of school children, Dr.
Allen compares the European method of
<em>doing things</em> at school with the American
method of <em>getting things done</em>.</p>

<p>No brief review can do justice to a work
so inspiring that to be instantly effective
it needs but to be read widely. It is filled
with material that should be particularly
at the command of every teacher, if not of
every parent, in the land. Its especial interest
to teachers of civics lies in its analysis
of the relation of public health and its
consequent economic conditions to organized
government and to the body social.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_58">American History in the Secondary School</h2>


<p class="authorindent">ARTHUR M. WOLFSON, PH.D., Editor.</p>

<p class="subtitleindent">A STUDY OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence is, in
every way, an ideal document for study
in a secondary school. Every student in
the class is undoubtedly familiar with it;
he has heard it quoted, in whole or in
part, on numberless occasions; he thinks
he knows all about it, and yet the teacher
can easily show him that it contains vast
stores of ideas which up to the present
time he has never even suspected. No
document in all American history is so
easy of interpretation: the language is
clear and simple; the phraseology is direct
and unencumbered; the document is divided
and subdivided so that anyone who takes
the trouble can easily analyze it. The
Declaration itself is to be found in almost
every school history, and the sources and
secondary authorities which illustrate it
are easily accessible and not too difficult
for the ordinary secondary school student.</p>


<h3>Literature.</h3>

<p>First, a few suggestions as to where
these sources and secondary authorities may
be found. Of primary importance is Macdonald’s
“Select Charters Illustrative of
American History&mdash;1606 to 1775;” second,
though not so good, is Preston’s “Documents
Illustrative of American History&mdash;1606
to 1863;” third, Hart’s “American
History Told by Contemporaries,” Volume
II, Part VI; fourth, the “American History
Leaflets,” Numbers 11, 19, 21, and
33. Beside these the teacher may easily
discover one or another of the documents
in many other places. Of the secondary
authorities, beside the ordinary
histories of the American nation, all of
which contain the leading facts and incidents
upon which the Declaration is based,
the teacher is referred especially to Friedenwald’s
“Declaration of Independence.”
Next to that, the most important works are
Moses Coit Tyler’s “Literary History of the
American Revolution,” and Frothingham’s
“Rise of the Republic of the United
States,” particularly the foot-notes. Furthermore,
the teacher and the student will
find illuminating essays on the political
theories of the Declaration of Independence
in Merriam’s “American Political Theories,”
in A. Lawrence Lowell’s “Essays in Government,”
in Leslie Stephen’s “English
Thought in the Eighteenth Century,” and
in Bryce’s “Studies in History and Jurisprudence.”
By no means all of these works
need be consulted; an examination of one
or two of them will suffice.</p>

<p>The study of the Declaration falls naturally
into three parts and students may
therefore profitably be set to work separately
or in groups on one of its three problems.
First, there is the problem of the
growth of the idea of independence; second,
there is the problem of the validity and
cogency of the numberless adverse criticisms
of the Declaration. Is it merely a mass of
“glittering and sounding generalities of
natural right?” as Choate called it. Is it
a partisan and unfair statement? Is its
political theory false and therefore of no
historical importance? Third, there is the
possibility of submitting the Declaration itself
to complete and thorough class-room
analysis.</p>


<h3>Idea of Independence.</h3>

<p>Taking each of these problems separately,
let us endeavor to set in order first, the
sources which should be studied in tracing
the growth of the idea of independence in
the colonies. Up to 1761, though there had
been causes for differences of opinion between
the Crown and the colonies, none of
these causes had led to an open breach. In
1761 came the difficulty about the Writs of
Assistance in which James Otis took such
a prominent part. Otis’ speech on the
Writs of Assistance, and especially his
“Vindication of the House of Representatives”
and his “Rights of the Colonies”
may therefore be studied with profit. In
them will be found the first statement
of the American theory of government.
These documents may be found in Hart’s
Contemporaries, in the American History
Leaflets, and in various other places. Following
then in quick succession come the
various declarations of the colonies and the
various petitions to the Crown, beginning
with the Declaration of the Stamp Act Congress
issued in 1765 and ending with the
Olive Branch Petition issued in June, 1775.
Most of these documents can be found most
conveniently in Macdonald’s Select Charters
and the teacher can make his own selection
according to his taste and the size of his
class. The only thing to be emphasized in
the study of any or all of these documents
is the fact that, as Friedenwald expresses
it, in speaking of the First Continental Congress
(Declaration of Independence, p. 28),
“spirited and outspoken as were the resolutions
of the Congress of 1774 in stating
their demands, there is no sign among them
all that can rightly be interpreted as indicating
a wish for the establishment, even
remotely, of an independent government.”
The same facts can be gleaned from a study
of Tyler’s “Literary History of the American
Revolution,” Vol. I, p. 458 ff.</p>

<p>With the news of the rejection of the
Olive Branch Petition which reached the
colonies in November, 1775, begins a new
phase of the American Revolution. Thenceforward,
there is a rapid and steady growth
of the idea of political independence. The
development of this idea should be studied
in such documents as the declarations of the
various colonies, especially the Virginia
Declaration of Rights, June, 1776, and in
the writings of the Revolutionary leaders
such as Thomas Paine’s pamphlet entitled
“Common Sense” issued in January, 1776,
and the correspondence of John Adams.
The idea culminates, of course, in the
Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>“Under this aspect,” says Tyler (Vol. I, p.
477) comparing the Revolution to the Civil
War, “the American Revolution had just
two stages; from 1764 to 1776, its champions
were Nullifiers without being Secessionists;
from 1776 to 1783, they were Secessionists,
and as events proved, successful
Secessionists.”</p>

<p>Criticism of the Declaration of Independence
began with the animadversions of John
Adams in his letter to Pickering in 1822
and has continued ever since. First, it has
been declared that the ideas expressed in
the preamble are not new, that “there is
not an idea in it,” as Adams said, “but
what had been hackneyed in Congress for
two years before;” second, that the document
is partisan and that the statement of
grievances is unfair to the British Crown
and to Parliament; third, that the political
philosophy contained in the preamble is
false and contrary to the facts of history.</p>


<h3>Jefferson’s Reply.</h3>

<p>In a short paper like this it is impossible
to examine each of these criticisms in detail.
The teacher who is interested can
easily find in Friedenwald and in Tyler and
in the other authorities mentioned above
full and adequate discussion of each of
these charges. Here it must suffice to say
in answer to the first charge that Jefferson
himself in a letter to Madison, dated August
30, 1823, declared, “I did not consider
it any part of my charge to invent new
ideas altogether, and to offer no sentiment
which had ever been expressed before....
I thought it a duty to be, on that occasion,
a passive auditor of the opinions of others,
more impartial judges than I could be of
its merits and demerits.” In other words,
Jefferson’s task was not to invent, as
French publicists were prone to do on such
occasions, new theories of government, but
simply to express the ideas which were the
product of the political discussion which
was going on about him, and which would
be familiar and acceptable to the men in
America and in Europe to whom the Declaration
was addressed.</p>

<p>That the document is partisan is of
course true; but this is scarcely a valid
criticism. Neither Jefferson nor any of
his colleagues claimed to sit as judges between
the colonies and the mother country.
They were bound merely to put their claims
as strongly as they could, and then leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the judgment of the case to “a candid
world.”</p>

<p>Third, as long at the Declaration be
studied merely as an historical document,
it matters not whether its theories be false
or true; it matters only that the student
understand how completely its principles
dominated the minds of the men who had a
share in drawing up the document and the
minds of men both in America and in
Europe to whom it was addressed.</p>


<h3>The Declaration Analysed.</h3>

<p>Coming now to the analysis of the Declaration
itself, we find that it falls naturally
into three parts. First, there is the preamble
in which Jefferson and his colleagues
set forth the political theory current in the
colonies in 1776; second, there is the
enumeration of grievances by which the
colonists hoped to prove that the king had
violated their sacred rights, and finally
there is the conclusion, namely, “That
these United Colonies are, and of right
ought to be free and independent states.”</p>

<p>The political doctrine of the Declaration
is well known. Summed up in a single
phrase, it is commonly called the Compact
Theory of Government; that is, that all
men are born with certain “natural rights,”
that to secure these rights they enter by
their own consent into political unions (the
compact), that when these natural rights
are violated by those whom they have set
up to govern them, they have a right to
throw off the restraints of government, to
enter into a new compact, “to provide new
guards for their future security.” It used
to be supposed that Jefferson derived this
theory of government from the writings
of the French philosophers, of whom Rousseau
was the most famous. This idea, however,
has long since been exploded. We
know now that the American revolutionary
statesmen from Otis to Jefferson were impregnated
with good English ideas, that
they looked to John Locke, not to Rousseau,
as their master. The teacher should therefore
make clear to his students just what
the ideas of Locke were and especially the
occasion which gave them birth. It is not
a matter of chance that Locke’s Treatises
on Government were issued in the period
of the Revolution of 1688 and the student
should be made to understand this. For a
full discussion of the almost exact verbal
relation between the Declaration of Independence
and the writings of Locke the
teacher is referred to the books mentioned
at the beginning of this paper.</p>


<h3>The Colonial Grievances.</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most valuable class exercises
in connection with the Declaration of Independence
is an analysis of the grievances
set forth in the document and the effort to
find the specific acts upon which these statements
are based. Several of them refer to
acts and events whose history is obscure,
but most of them can easily be traced to
their sources. For a thorough analysis of
the grievances, the teacher should go to
Friedenwald, Chapters X and XI. Here we
can give only the briefest outline. Thus,
for instance, a search of the Journals of
the Board of Trade will show that at least
twenty important laws were rejected or suspended
by the Crown in 1773, that the consideration
of other laws was neglected sometimes
as long as four or five years (Sections
1 and 2); that the king absolutely forbade
his governors in 1767 and even earlier to
allow the colonial assemblies to organize
new counties in the Appalachian region
unless they were willing to deprive these
counties of representation (Section 3). The
facts upon which Sections 4, 5, and 6 are
based may be found in almost any school
history. The grievances stated in Sections
7 and 8 are again somewhat obscure and
cannot therefore be used with profit for
class-room discussion. The next three sections,
however, refer to acts and events
which grew out of the attempted enforcement
of the various acts of parliament between
1765 and 1775 and which can therefore
be found without difficulty. Sections
12 and 13 likewise are based on facts which
any student can discover in his text book.
The facts upon which Section 14, which
refers to the various acts of Parliament attempting
to regulate colonial trade and
colonial government, is based, the student
can again discover by consulting his history;
while the last four grievances which complain
of acts done by the king since the
outbreak of the Revolution can be analysed
with the greatest facility.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the Declaration needs
no special study. It follows naturally
from the preamble, and from the statement
of grievances which Jefferson and his colleagues
now considered as proved. The
irony, conscious or unconscious, of Jefferson’s
use of the exact language of the
Declaratory Act of 1766, always impresses
the student when the comparison is made
clear (Macdonald, Charters, p. 316). Another
fruitful comparison is with the Dutch
Act of Abjuration, of July 24, 1581 (Old
South Leaflets, No. 72).</p>

<p>The student should be required to know
exactly the language of the most significant
phrases of the conclusion; indeed, certain
striking and important phrases throughout
the Declaration may very well be set to
the students for exact memorization.</p>

<h3>Arrangement of Topics.</h3>

<p>The order in which the main topics shall
be presented to the class is settled in part
for the teacher by the particular text-book
in use. In fact, this feature of a book
may have been an important factor in its
selection. Almost every possible combination
of topics may be found in the text-books
now on the market, ranging all the
way from the strictly chronological presentation
of the events to an apparent disregard
of the time element altogether.
Among the former are to be found authors
who, though endeavoring to follow the
chronological order seek so to bind together
the events of a given century or
more that they may be considered as one
great topic. Such attempts at generalization,
however, may prove misleading to the
student. Almost any book, if rightly used,
allows the teacher a little latitude not only
in the choice of topics, but also in the order
of presentation. If the teacher skips about
too much it may lead to misconception and
confusion on the part of the student. If,
however, the text-book and the library
facilities at the command of the teacher
allow of considerable freedom in respect to
order, it is at the best a very perplexing
question to settle. It may be a comparatively
easy matter to reach a conclusion as
to the order of the first few topics, say to
the revival of the empire by Otto I, but
from that time forward to the Renaissance
so many combinations and arrangements
are possible that it becomes increasingly
difficult to hit upon an order which is entirely
satisfactory. The Crusades, for example,
may be considered before the
teacher has finished the struggle between
the popes and the emperors, for the most
important of these movements overlap this
great contest. Then there is the question
of how and where to give the student some
insight into English conditions so that he
may understand the relation of that country
to the main stream of European development.
Again there is the question of
just where and in what connection to present
the life and culture so that it may
leave the most lasting impression. There
are many good reasons for leaving the presentation
of the Crusades until after the
struggle between the popes and emperors
and then considering the life of the times
especially in its connection with the rising
towns. It is an easy and a natural transition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from the development of trade as affected
by the Crusades to a consideration
of the towns themselves and town life.
Conditions here can be presented in a sharp
contrast to those discussed earlier in connection
with feudalism.</p>


<h3>The Thirteenth Century as a Turning Point.</h3>

<p>It has been suggested that 1268 be
selected as a turning point in the history
of Europe, marking as it does the practical
disappearance for the time being of the
empire as a factor in politics, the beginning
of the decline of the papacy, and the
rise of the third estate, which is illustrated
in England by the growth of the House of
Commons and in Germany and Italy
by the two great city leagues and the
power of Venice, Florence and Genoa.
If this suggestion is followed, the Hundred
Years’ War and the history of the
papacy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
may serve to introduce the Renaissance
if a discussion of the latter is preceded
or followed by a general summary of
the political situation in Europe at the
opening of the sixteenth century, with
special reference to those powers, both new
and old, which are to dominate in the new
period.</p>


<h3>Absence of Unifying Elements.</h3>

<p>The attempt to bridge the period between
the Hundred Years’ War and the
Renaissance and Reformation is attended
with a great many real difficulties, which
are aggravated rather than lightened by the
usual arrangement of material to be found
in the text-book. There is not only an
apparent absence of unifying elements, but
the impression created on teacher and student
is that of turmoil and confusion, with
here and there a situation full of dramatic
interest. “Only the closest attention,” declares
one writer, “can detect the germs of
future order in the midst of the struggle
of dying and nascent forces, ... The
dominant characteristic of the age is its
diversity, and it is hard to find any principle
of coördination.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Although the task
before the secondary teacher is not an
easy one, it is possible by confining the
attention of the student to a few fundamental
facts successfully to meet the
problem.</p>

<p>The stories of the Babylonian Captivity
and the Great Schism can be so presented
that they will serve not only to accentuate
the great change which was taking place in
Western Europe in the formation of powerful
States like England, France and Spain,
but in such a manner as to make clearer
the Renaissance in Italy, and the wave of
religious reform which swept over Europe
before this earlier movement had entirely
spent its force. The student can easily appreciate
the contrast presented by the condition
of the papacy in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries and its might in the
days of Gregory VII and Innocent III.</p>

<p>It is more difficult just here to show how
these events were connected with the Renaissance.
A number of circumstances combined
together in Italy to accentuate city
development, not the least of which was
the failure of the popes and emperors to
realize their dreams of universal dominion.
The final overthrow of the Hohenstaufen
has already been discussed. Probably no
set of circumstances contributed more to
bring the papacy into disrepute and reduce
them to the position of Italian princes
forced to look after their own private affairs
than the conditions which prevailed in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The
effects, then, of the residence at Avignon
and the circumstances attending the return
to Rome, call for special emphasis.</p>

<p>Although the schism was healed by the
Council of Constance, so little was done by
this assembly and the other councils which
followed it to reform the abuses which had
crept into the Church, that it is not strange
that the demand for a reform voiced by
such men as Erasmus and Luther in the
sixteenth century met with a warm reception
in so many quarters. This great movement,
which has been called the Protestant
revolt, becomes clearer if the attention has
been drawn to the teachings and work of
Wycliffe and Huss, who even at this early
date uttered words which were by no
means lost. With these facts in mind, not
forgetful of the decided tendencies toward
the formation of strong states, each sufficient
unto itself, to which reference has
already been made, the establishment of
national churches in the sixteenth century
does not impress the student as a strange
phenomenon incapable of explanation.</p>


<h3>Europe at Opening of Sixteenth Century.</h3>

<p>A survey of the political situation at the
beginning of the sixteenth century will not
only serve to deepen some of the impressions
already made, but will furnish the
student with a vantage point from which
he can appreciate the better the great
changes which were soon to follow. Such
a summary should be made with a map
before the class, and all should be urged to
marshal the salient facts in the history of
the different countries as they come up for
consideration. The order to be followed
will, of course, depend somewhat on the
treatment of the Renaissance. The logical
order perhaps would be to take the older
states first and then the more recent
powers, like Spain, the Ottoman Turks,
Switzerland, possibly including the Baltic
peninsula. The following simple outline is
offered merely as a suggestion, and can be
amplified at the discretion of the teacher
so as to include a wider survey.</p>

to some extent in the treatment of Germany

<h3>Bibliography.</h3>

<p>The text-book will probably furnish adequate
material not only for the Hundred
Years’ War itself, but for the gradual development
of France and England in the
years preceding the struggle. Lodge, in the
preface to “The Close of the Middle Ages,”
states some of the problems involved in
a study of the period. In his concluding
chapter he attempts to characterize the
Middle Ages and show their relation to the
Renaissance. Seignobos’ “History of
Medieval and Modern Civilization” contains
two well-written chapters on “The End of
the Middle Ages and the Establishment of
Absolute Power in Europe” (chapters xv-xvi).
Summaries of the political situation
at the close of the Middle Ages are to be
found in most of the text-books. Chapter
xxiii in Robinson, “Western Europe,” portrays
conditions at the beginning of the
sixteenth century. In the source books of
Thatcher and McNeal, of Robinson and of
Ogg are found extracts illustrating the history
of the papacy during the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries. The former marshals
all the important documents together
in a section entitled “The Church. 1250-1500.”
Robinson’s selections are perhaps as
useful as any for the light they throw on
the reform movement. Froissart’s “Chronicles,”
furnish abundant material on the
Hundred Years’ War.</p>

<p class="subtitleindent">SPARTA, ATHENS, THE PERSIAN WARS.</p>


<h3>The Greek Weakness.</h3>

<p>The fact that we are now to trace the
very distinct development of Athens and of
Sparta points out an essential characteristic
of the Greek race: their division into
rival and warring states. A fine question
to arouse thought on the part of pupils is:
How could little states so near together as
Attica, Laconia, Arcadia and Bœotia come
to differ so in their characteristics? Why
were they not all developed nearly along
the same lines, like the people of the United
States? Let the children be brought to see
that the lack of means of communication,
in contrast with our post and telegraph and
newspaper, goes far to explain this. This
isolated development, in spite of the common
language, games and festivities, was
the perpetual weakness of Greece.</p>


<h3>Sparta; Her Strength and Her Limitations.</h3>

<p>Sparta, unlike Attica, was essentially a
military State. Her chief town needed no
walls because it was always an armed
camp. Botsford well points out that in
earlier times the Spartans were probably
the superiors of the Athenians in culture
and refinement; but their self-imposed discipline
made them a race of soldiers. We
know that the Periœci were successful
artisans and traders; but the controlling
passion of the little nation was military
efficiency. Everything seems to have been
sacrificed to that. When the classes come
to the glories of the Athenian golden age,
it will be well to point out that while she
has her scores of names which are luminous
in art, literature, science and philosophy,
from the annals of Sparta the world knows
mainly <a id="Link_61a"></a>Lycurgus, the lawgiver, and Leonidas,
the hero of Thermopylæ. If a teacher
is inclined to cultivate in his pupils the
idea that military glory is not to be the
main concern, he may well use the Spartan
record. Yet Sparta with these limitations
played a mighty part in the story of the
Greek struggle. Her armed efficiency more
than once saved Greece as a whole when
the less practical Athenian system had
broken down.</p>


<h3>The Persian Wars.</h3>

<p>The names of the famous contests are enshrined
in the world’s admiration. Aside
from a formal knowledge of the fascinating
struggle, deeper things are to be considered.
What was the danger to Europe in
this Persian attack? Persians were of the
same race as Greeks. Why would it not
have been well for them in their might to
tack the little Greek city states on as part
of a great world empire? And the secret
of the success of Greece in repelling them
is to be found in the essential difference between
the thoughtful self-respecting Greek,
and the flogged and servile Persian. We
speak of the “man behind the gun.” In
those days it was the “man who held the
sword.”</p>


<h3>Athenian Development.</h3>

<p>Athens and Switzerland are popular synonyms
for democracy. Yet Switzerland has
only become truly democratic within the
past century, and Athens never was truly
so. This has been alluded to in a preceding
article. What did happen in Athens was a
wonderful growth from aristocratic exclusiveness
toward democracy. The gains that
were made brought about finally a state of
things that was never approached elsewhere
in the ancient world save possibly in
the Hebrew commonwealth. For this advance
all honor is due the men of Athens.
A comparative study of the earlier constitution
with the successive reforms of
Solon and Cleisthenes may well be used to
point out that the common people were
more and more coming into their own.
West, on p. 125 of his “Ancient World,”
has a table of some of these constitutions
which might well be completed as a blackboard
exercise. It will then at once become
apparent what direction reform was taking.
Note, however, the weakness of the executive
and the reason for it, i. e., the Greek
jealousy of individual or continued power.
Show how the tyranny of <a id="Link_61b"></a>Peisistratos was
almost the inevitable result of this weakness
of the executive. The exclusion of foreign
(even Greek) settlers from citizenship,
save in exceptional cases, was entirely
contrary to our ideas. And the existence
of slavery in the person of captives in war
and of poor debtors was a fatal blot on
the democracy and the welfare of Athens,
as of all the Greek States. The social
struggle, with its various mitigations of the
lot of the very poor parallels the political
strife. Our children are breathing in from
the papers and from current discussions the
idea that our social inequalities and our
contest between capital and labor are a
new phenomenon. They ought to learn that
such contest is almost world old. We have
new elements such as the vast individual
fortune and the part taken by the corporations,
both unknown in old Greece, but the
essential features of the struggle were the
same. And the tendency of twenty-four
hundred years ago as well as of to-day was
and is to give larger right and opportunity
to the common man.</p>


<h3>Greek Poetry and Architecture.</h3>

<p>Some school historians and teachers decry
the effort to mingle with the political history
any study of Greek art. But to the
writer’s mind that would be a robbery of
the children. Our modern life is so saturated
with things almost purely Greek in
origin that our budding citizens, who may
never get elsewhere a glimpse of the origins
of so much that is beautiful, ought surely
to get such glimpses now.</p>

<p>In towns large enough to contain varied
examples the teacher can show the Doric,
Ionic and Corinthian styles by going with
his classes to the buildings illustrative of
each, or at least by telling where such may
be found. In the smaller towns pictures
of famous buildings may be used. (Remember
that the dome is not Greek, but
Roman.) In like manner the poetry of the
Greeks may be used. The epic, the elegy,
the lyric and their great exemplars call for
mention. The drama comes a little later.
Meter appears to have been of Greek origin.
Some of its distinctions are worth a few
minutes. And here is opportunity for correlation
with the work in English literature.
Our poetic forms go back to the people
we are studying now. A recent writer
makes the caustic comment that with most
teachers correlation is “a poor relation.”
Rightly viewed, it would appear that no
subject better than history furnishes the
opportunity for side lights on other
branches of the student’s work. For here
we get the beginnings of so many things
that are commonplaces with us. But they
were new once, and so many of the choicest
of them had their birth in the little land
and among the wonderful people of our
present study.</p>


<h3>A Digression.</h3>

<p>The difference between a good history
teacher and a poor one lies largely in the
skill and purpose of the former in making
his work vivid. Vividness is best secured
by a comparison of these ancient conditions
with our own. And it is a scholastic crime
that a child should be allowed to run away
with such a notion as this: that at Salamis
the “Greek forts on the shore bombarded
the Persian fleet and saved the day”; or
that “the Persians steamed away in despair.”
These are real examples. Such a
child needs waking up. Ask him if he
knows what a “Marathon runner” is, and
show that by means of such runners the
place of the telegraph in our modern life
was taken. Pictures may be made of great
service. Teachers in our great centers, who
have their own history rooms, with their
proper apparatus and adornments, have a
great advantage here; but humbler means,
like the Perry pictures, are available by all.</p>


<h3>Carthage and the Greeks.</h3>

<p>A topic often neglected is the Carthaginian
invasion of Sicily. That was part
of an age-long struggle between a great
commercial empire and the peoples of different
races whose main idea was not commercial
supremacy. Punic trader and
Spartan soldier have left small mark in the
temple of fame. Yet not long ago I heard
one of our modern iconoclastic historians
sharply question whether it might not have
been better for the world in the end if
Carthage had beaten both Greek and Roman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Athenian Empire.</h3>

<p>Doubtless trade plays a larger part in
political development than many people
think. And desire for trade and wealth
was a great motive in the upbuilding of the
Athenian empire out of the Delian League.
It is a shady chapter, like many another
island annexation. Similarly it may be
said that our spoiling the Dutch of New
Netherland was questionable. Yet but for
that we might have had no United States.
Politically speaking, out of evil good has
come. It was the half-pirated wealth of
Venice that led to her artistic glory. So
the wealth and the political pre-eminence
that Athens gained out of the Delian
League gave her genius means and scope
for its perfect flowering in the age of Pericles.
And that will bring us to our next
chapter.</p>

<p class="authorindent">C. B. NEWTON, Editor.</p>

<p class="subtitleindent">III. ADVANCE AND RETROGRESSION; THE HUNDRED YEARS’ WAR.</p>

<p>Progress is the keynote of the period we
have now reached. The rise of the House
of Commons, extending over the last of the
thirteenth and first of the fourteenth centuries,
the great laws of Edward I’s reign,
the growth of commerce, the national spirit
induced by the national triumphs at Crecy
and Poitiers are some of the larger landmarks
in the forward march of the English
nation during the hundred years following
Henry III. Even the troubled years which
followed the black death, the upheavals in
society and religion in the latter fourteenth
century, were the throes of progress. Then,
but for the brief glories of Henry V, comes
a time of halting&mdash;the miserable end of the
long and useless conflict with France, the
turbulence and lawlessness of the baronage,
the weakness of the king, all combine to
bring about a period of retrogression, when
the pulse of the nation beats low and the
tides of progress were stayed. Soon the
purging bloodshed of the Wars of the Roses
and the strong hand of the Tudors started
once more the healthy growth which had
been checked. Some such general survey,
presented, perhaps on the blackboard by a
line of the kind used to indicate seismic
disturbances, or given in some brief direct
notes taken down verbatim, will serve as a
clearer of the atmosphere, an indicator of
the trend of things during this difficult
period.</p>


<h3>A Problem in Quantities.</h3>

<p>I say “difficult” because I find myself,
when I reach the great reign of his Majesty
Edward I, ’twixt a veritable Scylla and
Charybdis, past whom I steer with annual
apprehension. I know I must take a middle
course, but I have not yet satisfied
myself that I have found the <em>best</em> channel
for the precious cargo that I carry. Scylla
is the danger of too little detail, the devouring
monster of over-definiteness; Charybdis
is the equal danger of too much
detail, the menace of the minutiæ which
defeat their own purpose, and confound in
the whirlpool of mental confusion.</p>

<p>Let me explain more concretely. The
origin and development of the House of
Commons is a highly important subject. It
behooves me to impress its history as
lucidly and forcibly as may be upon my
class. But it is a subject beset with obscurities
and difficult to make clear to an
immature mind. I may ignore all the obscurities
and the conflicting details, and
may simply emphasize the principal landmarks&mdash;the
first inclusion of the “commons”
in Simon de Montfort’s parliament
of 1265; the cementing of Simon’s innovation
in the Model Parliament of 1295, and
the separation of the upper and lower
Houses early in Edward III’s reign. This
is the method of some of the older text-books.
It is clear cut, simple, definite. But
is it true? Certainly not unqualifiedly no.
My love of truth warns me that I must
not make it so definite, so conveniently cut
and dried, so absolute if I am to convey the
historical facts. On the other hand, suppose
I resolve to go into more strictly
accurate detail. Shall I call forth the note-books
and painstakingly explain that representatives
of the shires were first summoned
by King John in 1213; that two
knights from each shire were called to parliament
in 1254; that in 1261 three knights
were summoned; in 1264, <em>four</em>; in 1265,
two knights and two burgesses; in 1275,
two knights; but that the practice of summoning
knights of the shire and citizens of
the towns did not become in any sense continuous
till 1295? If I do this, I must go
further and try to give some of the reasons
for this desultory and varying practice,
and before I am done, I have made
a fine muddle in my pupils’ heads! I have
shipwrecked both interest and comprehension,
and I am not much nearer conveying
truth than I would have been by the former
method. So, too, I must beware of giving
or allowing the impression that parliament
was in any sense a legislative body at this
period, and at the same time I must have a
care lest in trying to explain its functions
not always too clear to the more advanced
scholar, I explain too much and mislead
where I would enlighten.</p>

<p>The same difficulty presents itself in the
effort to give the gist of the great laws of
Edward I and of Edward III. Some of
these laws are very hard to express simply;
some of them were enacted over and over
again. Yet the principles for which they
stood, and their subsequent effects can
hardly be overlooked. Again, as in the case
of the House of Commons, I must be definite
and simple, and yet not too definite or
too simple.</p>

<p>Of course, this is nothing more than the
problem of selection which confronts historians
and teachers at many points, but
rather more persistently at some points
than others. There is no patent solution
for the problem, but I believe it helps immensely
to be thoroughly alive to it, and to
keep two principles steadily in mind when
we find the difficulty particularly acute&mdash;(1)
that strong meat is not for babes, and
that the finer points of a discussion such
as that which concerns the growth of the
lower branch of parliament should be reserved
for university work; (2) that
though truth may be better subserved by
bringing out essentials clearly, even with
over-emphasis, yet it is possible to suggest
qualifications which will leave loopholes for
further modification. For instance, the
parliaments of 1265 and 1295 may be emphasized
as the first and second steps in
the beginning of the House of Commons,
yet it may be explained that as early as
John’s reign knights of the shire were
occasionally summoned to parliament.</p>

<p>I have dwelt at some length on this subject
because, self-evident as it may seem,
it is full of pitfalls which only the utmost
vigilance will avoid.</p>


<h3>A Plea for Life and Color.</h3>

<p>Fortunately there is plenty of stirring
action to offset the tedium (to boys and
girls) of laws and parliaments. Bannockburn,
Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourt&mdash;what an
array of names to conjure with! Let us
not be parsimonious, fellow teachers, when
we reach these vantage grounds of glory!
Let us not be ultra-orthodox in our scientific
view of history. In the reaction, the
very proper reaction from the view of history
which made it a mere record of wars
and battles there is danger of making it a
valley of dry bones. After all, it is the
record of life, and the events which have
stirred the imagination and aroused the
patriotism of millions are not to be too
lightly set aside. Let the young imagination
“drink delight of battle with its
peers”; let it see what was really noble
as well as what was base in chivalry.
Surely it is worth while that it should
catch the life and color of those middle
ages&mdash;so different, yet after all so human.
Froissart has given us this in a form now
easily accessible, or failing a complete edition
of his “Chronicles,” Cheyney’s “Readings”
furnish a taste (pp. 233-249), but
hardly enough, for only Crecy is here described.
Green, as usual, is vivid in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
battle accounts&mdash;Bannockburn, pp. 213 and
214; Crecy, Calais, and Poitiers, pp. 225-230;
and Agincourt, pp. 267-268. Henry
V’s speech in Shakespeare’s play of “Henry
V” is too splendid in its rhetoric to be
overlooked. Sometimes a laggard in the
class loves to declaim, and may be stirred
to some interest by such a speech. Here
is the chance to make him useful.</p>

<p>And then the story of Joan of Arc, with
its unspeakable beauty and pathos, comes
as a noble climax, a spiritual contrast, to
the series of events the glamour of which
is at best of the earth earthy in comparison
with the life and death of the Maid. Gardiner’s
“Student’s History” contains a
very concise account of her life, pp. 310-312.
The extracts from contemporary writings,
pp. 289-296 of Cheyney’s “Readings” are
very interesting and illuminating. Green’s
account, pp. 274-279, is vivid, especially
the story of her trial and death, p. 279.
Reference to the great performance given
in the Harvard Stadium last June by Maud
Adams would add reality and interest to
the study of Joan of Arc. An interesting
account of this, with pictures, may be
found in “Current Literature” for August,
1909, pp. 196-199.</p>

<p>For a very interesting detailed account of
the beginnings of the House of Commons,
see the extended quotation from Stubbs’s
“Select Charters” in Beard’s “Introduction,”
pp. 124-157.</p>

<p>In discussing the “black death” and its
effects, it is worth while to point out the
revolution wrought by modern medicine
and sanitation to which is due the absence
of such plagues from modern Europe. The
“bubonic plague,” which still devastates
India, is much like the “black death,” and
the failure of the English to exterminate it
in India is due to the superstitious dread
and suspicion with which the natives regard
all efforts toward inoculation, segregation
and disinfection. In the “Readings,” pp.
255-257, is a contemporary account of the
plague which not only paints it realistically,
but shows its effects on labor.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_63">Civics in the Secondary School</h2>


<p class="authorindent">ALBERT H. SANFORD, Editor.</p>

<p class="subtitleindent">THE CORRELATION OF AMERICAN HISTORY AND CIVICS.</p>

<p>In the year 1906 a committee of the North Central History
Teachers’ Association made an investigation of the relations existing
between American History and Civics in secondary schools, their
report being printed in the Proceedings of that date. A portion
of the report consisted of an outline showing the possibility of
correlating many topics in these two subjects. In response to
numerous requests this portion of the report is here re-printed. In
their conclusions, the committee recommended correlation as far
as this is feasible; but they emphasized the fact that many important
topics in Civics would not be adequately treated by this method,
and hence should be taught separately. The arguments supporting
this and other conclusions are to be found in the full report referred
to above. The committee consisted of the following: Albert H.
Sanford, Carl Russell Fish, Mildred Hinsdale, C. C. Bebout, and
Mary Louise Childs.</p>

<p>It is not intended that the Civics topics stated above shall be
treated exhaustively; the mere fact of the existence of the organizations
that correspond to the colonial types is the extent of the
correlation at this point. (Reasons for this restriction will be
stated later.) The important thing is that the pupil be taught
not to associate these institutions exclusively with the localities
in which they originated, but to regard them as the typical forms
of organization of those different elements of our population which
they carried, or rather under which they marched, westward.</p>

<p>It will be noticed in (1) and (2) that the comparisons are between
particular facts of our history and some of the more general
features of our National government. The details of present
conditions may not be understood by students who have not
studied Civics separately.</p>

<p class="center p1">(3) CONSTITUTIONAL PERIOD.</p>

<p>Under the topics that follow, we find the history of our present
National government, seen in the formation of the Constitution
and the workings of the government thus formed. The natural
correlation, then, is between the event (either in the Constitutional
Convention or in our later history) and that part of the Constitution
which thus came about, or which forms the basis for the
action of the government described.</p>

<p>The historical topics are not arranged in strictly chronological
order, but in the sequence in which they are usually treated. In
most cases no mention has been made of events which show the
working of the government under a clause of the Constitution
that has once been included; for instance, not all the important
treaties of our history are mentioned. Enough attention should
be devoted to the clause when first mentioned to fix it in the mind
of the pupil. In some instances, however, there is repetition of
this kind, particularly where the interpretation has changed from
time to time.</p>

<h3>OXFORD SUMMER SCHOOL.</h3>

<p>The Oxford Summer School has two
souls. The student feels the influence of
each from the moment he enters the examination
halls&mdash;nay, as he hurries down
High Street, “the glorious High Street,”
which Wordsworth’s sonnet has enshrined.
In spite of the groups of foreigners talking
together in their mother tongues as they
too hasten towards the meeting, in spite of
the single women who wear English boots,
and speak with the English gentlewoman’s
mellifluous voice, in spite of tall blonde German
students arguing vociferously but
good-naturedly, in spite of the whole one
thousand three hundred men and women,
who are gathering together for another renewed
quickening in modern thought along
educational lines, one feels a throng of
ghosts pressing in upon him&mdash;ghosts of
memories which surge as really as does the
crowd itself. One feels the spirit of To-day
and To-morrow taking hold of him and the
spirit of Yesterday whispering in his ears.
One should be Janus-faced in Oxford, for
the soul of the Past and the soul of Now
beckon each in its own way. One cannot
turn a corner of the high walls, or pass
through a gateway, or wander through a
cloister, without feeling the ineffable
beauty of the past, the intangible glory of
the days of Wolsey and Cranmer and Cromwell
and Reginald Pole, or the later gorgeousness
of Charles I and the army of Royalists
who held high carnival here before
their downfall. Men who have made modern
thought possible, poets, essayists, historians,
scientists, one touches the influence
of their work at every step, as well as
meeting them face to face from their portraits
upon the walls of college banqueting
halls or chapter houses. Everywhere one
feels even a still greater power, the ecclesiastical
domination, which in early days peopled
this glorious city with its monks,
friars, priests and bishops. One’s imaginations
runs riot as he peers from a cloister
walk, when the chimes are jangling. He
all but sees the Benedictine Friars, and he
does not need to await their coming across
the soft, velvety green, under the spreading
limes, or oaks, they are there, their breviaries
in their hands, their heads bowed.</p>

<p>But while the student conjures up the
men who made Oxford in the thirteenth,
and fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, the
men of the twentieth century are pressing
against him with human force, and he finds
himself crossing High Street once more
with the surging crowd. He has learned
to differentiate the members of the school
still further. This group are Swedes; and
another Danes; those men, with a scattering
of women, are Socialists; the bevy of
black-eyed, red-cheeked girls come from
France; they are trying in three weeks to
rub up their convent English. Then there
are so many round-faced, round-bodied German
fraus, the embodiment of comfortableness,
who have come over with their theoretical
husbands. And surely some of
these German students seem to need just
such “help-mates” to keep them attached
to earth. As one sits in the gallery of the
Sheldonian Theater one almost feels that a
map of the social world lies below, and that
the little groups of persons are types of
the great nations themselves: the eager
nations of Europe and America, the live
nations which are searching after the solution
of world-problems.</p>

<p>The Oxford Summer School of 1909 has
undertaken to present courses in three
major subjects: the contribution of medieval
and modern Italy to world-civilization
is its history course. In economics the discussion
of industrial problems and trades-unions
is drawing together large audiences,
and arousing intense interest. Methods of
education which shall bring a quickening
to the professional world itself is a third
line of thought. In connection with the
historical course, the literature, science and
art each finds a large place. Perhaps no
former summer school has offered a more
concrete and wisely-arranged program
than that of this year’s summer meeting in
Oxford. The delegacy has so arranged the
courses that an intensity of thought gives
an opportunity for most remarkable concentration
in data. Three weeks is but a
very short time for one to attend lectures,
especially if the lectures are scattering, a
subject here and a subject there. But this
concentration of interest upon medieval and
modern Italy, this intensive study of Dante
and his contemporaries, this presentation of
Italian thought, government and politics, as
well as Italian art and society, give a continuity
and a rounding out to the subject
presented.</p>

<p>To illustrate the wisdom of the delegacy.
The summer meeting was opened by an
address by the Italian Ambassador, Marquis
Di Guiliano, and from the opening
words of this Italian diplomat to the present
writing, the summer meeting has kept
to the thought which the orator himself
presented, our inheritance from Italy.</p>

<p>A word in regard to the delegacy. The
official heads are the vice-chancellor of the
university and the proctors, together with
the secretary, Prof. J. A. R. Marriott, M.A.,
who, with his assistant secretary, Miss
E. M. Gunter, are the active members of
the delegates, who number twenty and represent
the colleges of the university. The
summer meeting is divided into two parts:
First part from July 30 to August 11, and
the second from August 11 to 23. The tuition
for the two parts is but £1.10 and
working men and women may obtain the
above tickets at half price under certain
conditions. Not only are the courses so
arranged that the students may select companion
subjects out of these two sections
and focus their interests upon special work,
but the work itself is so outlined and
printed that syllabi may be obtained for
almost nothing. Thus the student has a
guide of thought with him at every lecture,
as well as something to carry away.
Among the great men who are lecturing at
the summer meeting are the Rev. W. Hudson
Shaw, already well known in the
United States; A. L. Smith, Ford lecturer
in English History; E. L. S. Horsburgh,
B.A., whose discussions on economic problems
are holding together conservative
theorists and advanced Socialists in remarkable
fashion, as he presents the topics
relating to industrial problems. George N.
Trevelyan, Rev. W. K. Stride, R. V. Leonard
and Edmund Gardner are here, and
other men whose manuals are also famous.
Perhaps the lectures on Dante by the Rev.
P. H. Wicksteed draw the largest audiences,
but the great class-rooms of the examination
schools are filled to over-flowing in
almost every case, so enthusiastic are the
students. One might throw in parenthesis
here that the undergraduate calls these
enthusiastic summer students “stretchers”
(another word for extensionists).</p>

<p>It would be impossible to compare an
American Summer School with the Summer
School at Oxford. I have attempted to
write only the first impressions that one
gains in this university town. Each traveller
gains a different impression doubtless,
and in order to gain that impression he
must come himself. My last word, therefore,
to my reader is not to remember my
impressions, but to plan to visit Oxford
and gain his own impression, and his own
individual quickening.</p>

<h3>SAN FRANCISCO GROUP.</h3>

<p>A group of about fifty history teachers,
representing the grades, the high school,
and the university, and living in the vicinity
of San Francisco, have formed the habit
of gathering informally at luncheon from
time to time, to meet socially and to discuss
questions of professional interest. At the
last meeting. September 18, the topic was
“The Practical Value of History.” Prof.
J. N. Powman opened with a stimulating
essay, and was followed by a general discussion.</p>

<p>These meetings are useful in enabling
history teachers of various grades to learn
what each other man is doing, and to discover
common aims. It is planned to continue
them at intervals of about three
months.</p>

<h2 id="Ref_66">Brown’s “The American High School”</h2>


<p class="authorindent">REVIEWED BY GEORGE H. GASTON.</p>

<p>In beginning his book, Dr. Brown shows
that the modern high school is the third
stage in the evolution of secondary education
in the United States; the first being
the Latin grammar school of colonial times,
and the second the academy flourishing between
the Revolution and the Civil War.
He makes it clear that the high school was
the natural consequence of the developing
political, social and industrial ideas of the
period. Its popularity is shown by its phenomenal
growth in fifty years.</p>

<p>Its function as now established is well
made one of the most important chapters
of the book, for it is the conception of purpose
that must determine its entire development,
as well as the measure of its usefulness.
In its relation to the elementary
school it is essentially continuation and
co-operation, accompanied by the many
changes suited to adolescence. Having at
first no vital relation to the college, it is
conceded that it should prepare for State
universities, where such exist, and for colleges
generally, but it must also serve the
best interests of those not going to college.
From the peculiar nature of our republic,
its function to the pupil is of such a nature
and must in such a manner be discharged
that culture, habits of industry,
a healthy civic spirit and increased social
efficiency will be some of the many rewards
for the great and increasing expenditure by
the State.</p>

<p>Following logically the function of the
high school, is the discussion of the educational
value of the different studies. Tradition
has prevented until recently any
such scientific examination of the studies
pursued in the high school. As to their
value in accomplishing the aim of education
as he conceives it, the author gives his estimate
of the various classes of subjects
from the standpoint of information, power,
character, social value, etc., and constructs
definite programs proceeding from this
study.</p>

<p>In the organization and management of
the high school there are many real problems
found in all, but their relative importance
varies with the size of the school.
The preparation of the teacher, his selection
and efficient supervision are some of
the most important considerations in working
toward the standards of the North Central
Association of Colleges and Secondary
Schools here produced and representing the
most advanced practical thought concerning
the essentials of a good high school.</p>

<p>Although not neglecting material equipment
with all it means in a modern high
school, it is gratifying to find it completely
subordinated to the living, active side of
the institution, the teacher, the principal
and the pupil. His treatment of principal
and of pupil reveals true pedagogical insight
and genuine sympathy, but it is the
teacher for whom he cherishes such advanced
ideals of academic and professional
training, of personality, and of experience,
that he characterizes as “by all odds, the
most influential factor in high school education.”</p>

<p>The real heart and life of the school is
reached in the keen and suggestive discussions
of the class exercise, character-forming
government, and the recently-conceived
possibilities of social development, with its
numerous and serious problems, one of
which only is the secret society.</p>

<p>There is inspiration in the high ideals of
the relations between high school and community.
For many reasons given, it is a
timely topic for teachers and parents, and
when even partially realized will aid in the
solution of present problems and help to
determine future development, two questions,
whose impartial and fundamental
treatment is a real stimulus and a safe
guide.</p>

<p>This book deserves wide reading for many
reasons. It is encouraging in spirit, but
fearless in criticism, which is everywhere
constructive; its style is simple and direct
throughout, thus adapting itself to the attention
of parents and school boards as
well as the profession; it deals with questions
vital to both large and small schools;
its bibliographies and illustrative material
in the appendices are pilots on a vast sea;
and a careful reading will result in a
greatly-increased faith in the present high
value and the boundless future possibilities
which the author cherishes in such large
measure for the American high school.</p>

<p>I am very much pleased with the <span class="smcap">Magazine.</span>
I hope that there may be a chance
in it for discussion of the course of study
of history for the secondary school. This
will not transgress the work of any committee,

deal with Ancient History for admission to

<p>What reasons would you give to a beginner
in history for studying the subject?
What reasons would you give to an advanced
pupil? <span class="aindent">S. S. F.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ans.</span>&mdash;Answers to this question will be
found in any of the manuals upon the
teaching of history, such as those by
Bourne, McMurray, Hinsdale, and in the
Report of the Committee of Seven. An excellent
summary of the reasons, together
with references to extended treatment of
the subject, will be found in Professor
Franklin L. Riley’s “Syllabus on the Teaching
of History,” privately printed by himself

solely to the teaching of history in the
grades. History, as well as other subjects,
is treated in “The Teacher’s Magazine”
and in the “School Review.” History in
the grades will be given an increasingly important
position in our own magazine.</p>

<p>(2) The best reference book upon the
teaching of history in the grades is the report
of the Committee of Eight, mentioned
in several places in this issue of the <span class="smcap">Magazine</span>.
Miss Sarah A. Dynes has in preparation
a book upon the subject.</p>

<p class="cgreet">Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>.</p>

<p>I would like to add my tribute to the
remarkable value of the new <span class="smcap">Magazine</span> for
us history teachers. I am delighted that
you recognize the importance of American
government as worthy of a place of its own
in your paper. We teachers of civics, who
have been struggling for years to give this
valuable subject a place in the curriculum
just because a certain group of colleges and
universities have persisted in refusing it
college entrance credit, rejoice when public
recognition is thus bestowed upon our subject.
We return with fresh interest and
courage to our efforts to teach the principles
of citizenship to the boys and girls under
our charge. As the basic idea of our course
is citizenship, I confess I much prefer the
term “Civics” to “American Government,”
in spite of Professor Schaper’s contempt for
such designation. It gives me a much
broader basis for my work than the narrower
term. <span class="aindent">M. L. C.</span></p>

<p class="cgreet center">HISTORICAL SOURCES IN PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS.</p>

<p>Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>:</p>

<p>The article in the September issue of <span class="smcap">The
History Teacher’s Magazine</span> entitled
“One Use of Sources in the Teaching of
History” is interesting both in its point
of view and in the concrete illustration of
the method presented by Professor Fling.
The “methods” pursued by different teachers
of history will vary largely and chiefly
in consonance with the respectively dissimilar
aims held in mind by the teachers.
I must own that an experience of ten years
in teaching history in the high schools of
New York City has engendered a more
modest purpose than that avowed by Professor
Fling; my own aim is less ambitious
than his and at the same time, perhaps,
more comprehensive; it may not be,
like his, based upon “my conception of educational
theory and of the logic of historical
science”; it is, however, based upon
a first-hand knowledge of the intellectual
attainments and limitations of girls and
boys of high school age.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a great difference in
mental power between pupils during the
time devoted to Greek history and during
that in which they are studying American
history and civics; there are, too, great
disparities in the children of the same
grades and in different schools, and yet I
think it is a safe generalization to declare
that broadly speaking, our pupils are surprisingly
immature and undeveloped mentally,
even when, as “sweet girl graduates,”
or their brothers, they leave us for
the struggle of life, or for college.</p>

<p>The public high school, supported as it
is by the money of the people, must necessarily
adapt itself to the needs of the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sent to it; the vast majority of our
pupils receive from us the “finishing
touches” of their formal education, as they
do not go to college, but plunge at once
into “the world.” Such being the fact,
what then should be the aim of the history
teacher? Should it be to inculcate
“the methodical search for truth,” using
the phrase in the sense evidently intended
by both M. Lanson and Professor Fling?</p>

<p>Remembering the specific task set before
us, viz.: insofar as we are able, to fit our
charges to grapple with the practical problems
of life, I am compelled to say that
such a training in the study of history as
Professor Fling thinks desirable for high
school pupils would be woefully one-sided
and inadequate.</p>

<p>We are not expected to train historians
nor historical specialists; we leave to the
colleges to discover unusual natural aptitudes
for investigation and research, and
we consider that in the universities the
post-graduate school finds its sphere
in the training of the historical expert; on
the other hand, to the high school is given
the privilege of <em>introducing</em> these younger
minds into the domain of history. And
while enforcing the importance of accuracy
and exactness in thinking and in forming
judgments of men and of events, it is not
only our task to inculcate “the methodical
search for truth,” but to throw open to the
pupils the literature of the subject, to show
them how to use books to arouse their interest
in scenes and countries removed by
time and space from themselves, to create,
too, an interest in the social life of times
present and past, and to inspire a sane
spirit of pride in our country and loyalty
to it.</p>

<p>The proper use of “Sources” for the
accomplishment of these results is not,
then, as I have come to think, in setting
such lessons as Professor Fling suggests in
the instance of the Battle of Salamis; personally
I rarely place in the hands of pupils
any sources. I have had few classes of sufficient
maturity of mind to profit by such
a course. I do, however, read and explain
to them such sources as I think will serve
to add reality, freshness and life to the
text. Contrary to Professor Fling, I think
that the only place for the “Sources” is in
the hands of the teacher and not in those
of the pupils; I do not believe in the so-called
“Source Method” of history teaching
in secondary schools; it is unsuited to
the mental capacity of the pupils and contributes
only indirectly to what I consider
the aims that should control our teaching
of history.</p>

<p>One remark made by Professor Fling is
almost naïve. He says: “Two exercises a
week would be enough for intensive critical
work.” Yes, it probably would be; especially
in Greek and Roman history, which
in our New York high schools is taught
but three times a week; it certainly would
be sufficient in English history in those of
our schools in which it is taught but twice
a week; and probably it would be sufficient
in American history and civics, which
is taught four times a week!</p>

<p class="cgreet">Editor <span class="smcap">History Teacher’s Magazine</span>:</p>

<p>The library or the laboratory method of
teaching history and literature has been
generally adopted. This method has some
difficulties that need to be overcome or the
method will fail and consequently be abandoned.
I believe that the method must be
a failure in many schools. Dr. MacDonald
has written a letter to the “Nation,” October
7, about the inadequate equipment for
teaching history and literature in universities
and colleges. In teaching science, suitable
apparatus must be made for every four
pupils. In teaching history and literature
in a high school, reference books ought to
be provided every four pupils in the same
subject. The difficulty in teaching history
in the high school is greater than in teaching
science, as pupils pursuing different subjects,
as ancient history, medieval history
and modern history, often need the same
reference books. If pupils are required to
read four hundred pages, more or less, in
some history other than the school text, a
pupil may average about fifty pages a
month. But not more than ten per cent.
of the number can get the books required
for this reading.</p>

<p>I think the whole system is wrong. No
definite number of pages should be required.
Instead of this plan, topics should be assigned
to be gotten up and written in note-books.
Suppose the topic should be, “Trace
the course of the Visigoths from Adrianople
till they blend with the Spanish people”;
or, “Give a narrative account of
Napoleon’s Russian campaign, accompanied
with suitable maps.” The preparation of
these topics may require the reading of two
hundred or more pages. Each pupil, during
the year, should prepare not less than four
such topics. This work for all our pupils
will fill twenty-five thousand pages of note-book
work. This is too much reading and
correcting for our teachers. Therefore, the
teachers ought not to undertake to read
and correct the note-books. They ought,
however, to inspect them. Each topic
should he headed with a summary, and
with a statement of authorities used. I
think that an oral narration of the written
work should be made by some pupil or by
more than one pupil, and a criticism or discussion
by members of the class should be
made.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to have the views of
others on this important subject. I have
confined what I have written to teaching
history. The teaching of literature will require
a different plan.</p>

<p class="drop-capi-f">For a number of years we have published
Professor Caldwell’s books,
“Survey of American History,”
“Great American Legislators” and
“American Territorial Development,”
which were originally issued
in the form of leaflets consisting
practically of lectures delivered by the author.
In the making of the new book we propose to
make it as nearly perfect as possible, typographically
and mechanically. It has been decided
to insert maps, the book being intended for
advanced work in high schools and for students
taking a special course in American History.
It is proposed to divide the book into four
chapters as follows:</p>

<p class="hangindent">CHAPTER I.&mdash;The Making of Colonial
America, 1492-1763</p>

<p class="hangindent">CHAPTER II.&mdash;The Revolution and Independence,
1763-1786</p>

<p class="hangindent">CHAPTER III.&mdash;The Making of a Democratic
Nation, 1786-1841</p>

<p class="hangindent">CHAPTER IV.&mdash;The Slavery and Sectional
Struggle, 1841-1877</p>

<p>The tentative plan of the book as proposed is

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
